"One function of the SG-SSPN subcomplex is to stabilize ␣-DG at the sarcolemma (Holt et al., 1998). By examining extraction of ␣-DG with SDS, we show that disruption of proper SG-SSPN protein interactions within the sarcolemma of SSPN-Tg muscle results in destabilization of ␣-DG. The role of ␣-DG in organization of the extracellular matrix has been well-established (Brown et al., 1999;Henry and Campbell, 1998;Henry et al., 2001;Kanagawa et al., 2005). We now show that SSPN overexpression disrupts formation of the extracellular matrix, as revealed by uncoupling of perlecan, laminin and collagen VI co-localization and as seen by electron microscopy. Laminins represent one of the major components of the extracellular matrix and mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which encodes laminin-␣2 chain, cause congenital MD (Allamand et al., 1997;Helbling-Leclerc et al., 1995;Miyagoe-Suzuki et al., 2000). Although the DGC is normally expressed in mouse models with defects in laminin (dy/dy, dy w /dy w , dy 3k /dy 3k , dy Pas /dy Pas , dy 2j /dy 2j ; dy = Lama2), the linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton is disrupted (Besse et al., 2003;Guo et al., 2003;Kuang et al., 1998;Miyagoe et al., 1997;Sunada et al., 1994;Xu et al., 1994). We provide **data** to demonstrate that the extracellular matrix, including laminin, exhibits abnormal structure in phenotypic SSPN-Tg muscle. Taken together, our **data** support a necessary role for SSPN in organizing proteins within the DGC and in assembly of the extracellular matrix.",yes,25460449,6/31,3,25460449_6/31_3,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,
"The current results should be considered relative to a few study limitations. The CFS **data** did not specify the nature of proactive activities that patrol, DRT officers, or investigators were engaged in. Furthermore, although the coding of the ten call categories analyzed were informed by prior research (Wu & Lum, 2017), idiosyncrasies associated with the study departments' method of cataloging and recording call information did not always allow for direct comparisons to prior research on COVID-19's impact on police services. Similarly, measuring proactivity solely through self-initiated activities from CFS **data** is not a flawless indicator. Officers may engage in proactive work that is not captured in these **data** (Lum, Koper, et al., 2020).

"The findings from this systematic review highlight that EPA and DHA have differential effects on some cardiometabolic risk factors and that, to some degree, this effect is dependent on the study population. Both EPA and DHA are effective at lowering triglycerides, although there is evidence that DHA may lower triglycerides more than EPA. Whilst neither omega-3 PUFA alters total cholesterol to a great degree, DHA appears to increase HDL cholesterol, particularly the more cardioprotective HDL 2 subfraction, whilst EPA decreases HDL 3 cholesterol. DHA increases LDL cholesterol more than EPA, and more so in men than in women, and also increases LDL particle size, which may be less atherogenic. From the more limited trial **data** available, DHA may be more effective than EPA at lowering heart rate and blood pressure in normotensive individuals, whilst both EPA and DHA inhibited platelet function but had no effect on fibrinolytic function. Whilst inconsistent findings were reported for the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory markers and glycaemic control, both omega-3 PUFAs were able to lower oxidative stress, which is increased in certain subjects such as diabetics thereby increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease.",yes,4042856,89/130,1,4042856_89/130_1,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

"Since the authors have proposed and verified that human capital accumulation promoted GTP [8] and pointed out in the introduction that the CW-regions had comparative advantages in human capital, this paper further proposes proposition 1: the comparative advantage of human capital in the CW-regions of China has prompted these regions to choose GTP more. If the CW-regions choose GTP more between the two technologies, according to the above analysis in this section, we can further put forward proposition 2: the CW-regions of China will gain the backwardness advantage of green development for choosing GTP more.

"Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that affects the mucus glands of the lungs, liver, pancreas, and intestines, causing progressive disability due to multisystem failure. The CFTR gene, found in Chromosome 7, is the cause of cystic fibrosis, where mutations result in proteins that are too short because of premature end to production. We have been analyzing **data** on cystic fibrosis for the School of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, and because of confidentiality issues we cannot present these **data** in this paper. Although these **data** are very sparse with only a few individuals reported cystic fibrosis in southern Georgia, our **data** set has the same structure as one that has been used repeatedly in the literature. Table 1 gives a set of **data** on cystic fibrosis, which was presented by Crow [3] to illustrate the need to take account of the method of ascertainment in segregation analysis. One can countthe total number of offspring to be 269, the total number of affected offspring to be 124, and the total number of probands to be 90. Thus, one might estimate the segregation ratio to be 124/269 = .4610, and the ascertainment probability to be 90/124 = .7258. Again, these simple estimates are too inflated. Note that 46.1% is far in excess of the 25% expected on simple recessive inheritance (cystic fibrosis is autosomal recessive). One reason for the excess is the ascertainment bias -the exclusion of families where the parents are heterozygous, but fail to have a homozygous recessive child. These would add to the number of normal children and thereby reduce the proportion affected.

"Profiling was performed in a single batch in JHS and two batches of N = 88 and N = 121 in HERITAGE using the Olink Explore panel (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions using separate aliquots. The Proximity Extension Assay technology used for the Olink protocol has been described (5), and Olink enables analysis using 2.8 l of each sample. Briefly, pairs of oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probes bind to their targeted protein, and if the two probes are brought in close proximity, the oligonucleotides hybridize in a pair-wise manner. The addition of a DNA polymerase leads to a proximity-dependent DNA polymerization event, generating a unique double-stranded DNA barcode for each specific antigen. The resulting DNA sequence is subsequently detected and quantified using next-generation sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq). Data are then quality-controlled and normalized using an internal extension control and a plate control, to adjust for intra-and interrun variation. The final assay readout is presented in Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) values, which is log 2 -transformed ratio of sample assay counts to extension control counts; a higher value corresponds to a higher protein expression.

Hybridization was performed on two different dates and 4 samples from the first hybridization batch were re-hybridized with the second batch. These technical replicates clustered adjacent to one another in hierarchical analysis, indicating a negligible batch effect on the data. This was confirmed by testing for batch effect in the probe-by-probe analysis of variance. The expression intensities were averaged for each probe in the statistical analysis.

"Unlike most studies that use 2D-DIGE to identify exclusively those proteins that are differentially expressed between different samples, we were also interested in the expression profiles of proteins/isoforms whose abundance did not change significantly (ANOVA, P > 0.01) across the four different TP samples. We therefore employed a second statistical measure of variation, the relative standard deviation (defined as standard deviation divided by arithmetic mean), to assess explicitly the reproducibility of protein abundance measurements. The relative standard deviation was calculated for each protein spot for each of the four TP samples, and the median of these four values was taken as a measure of experimental reproducibility for that spot (see Figure 2c and Table 2 [35]). Comparison of these values with the graphical representation of the raw **data** (see Additional **data** file 1) illustrates the spread of the data.
