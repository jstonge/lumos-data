29984578,3/6,4.0,0.5,"Consequently, we conclude that Rad17p-Rad17p interaction can occur independently of the Rad17p⅐Mec3p⅐Ddc1p complex and participation of Rad17p in two separate, possibly competing complexes can be assumed. One wonders if Rad17p might be able to form PCNA-like homotrimeric structures as originally suggested (40). However, MEC3 expressed from a multicopy plasmid does neither enhance nor reduce Rad17p-Rad17p interaction and thus no indication for a competition between different Rad17p-containing complexes was found (data not shown). Alternatively, the **data** are also consistent with a simultaneous complex formation of Rad17p with itself and Mec3p. One could envision multimeric aggregate formation of a PCNA-ring-like Rad17p⅐Mec3p⅐Ddc1p complex on DNA, mediated by Rad17p homomeric interactions. We currently favor this hypothesis because Rad17p but also Mec3p self-interactions have been indicated for the human homologues (hRad1, hHus1, Ref. 46), thus possibly hinting at an evolutionary conserved capability of the heterotrimer to form higher order complexes. On the other hand, protein elution profiles in S. pombe did not indicate any shift in Hus1 protein association following DNA damage by ionizing radiation (44). However, all of the complexes detected in this study were larger in size than the predicted single heterotrimeric complex."

However, depending on the public tiling array **data** and mutant phenotypes, apparently, the function of AtMKK10 that is catalytically inactive is associated with pollen development despite the sequence change in phosphorylation site (Fig. 6b, c). According to our RT-qPCR experiments, BdMKK10-5 have same situation in its phosphorylation site is up-regulated after UV-B treatment (Additional file 20). More interesting, previous studies had shown that the average root growth rate for double mutant MKK10/MPK3 or MKK10/MPK6 was higher than anyone single mutant of them [55], and also the transcripts of MKK10 significantly changed after PPV-infected protoplasts [56]. More studied have been reported showed that part mutant MAPKK gene was involved with disease resistance in rice and ethylene-dependent cell death in maize, respectively, which can phosphorylate MAPK6 and MAPK3 in vivo [57,58]. Furthermore, AtMKK10 have experienced mutations in phosphorylation key active site and exhibited different expression profiles from AtMKK7/8/ 9 (Fig. 6a). So, the mutant paralogs might still maintain the kinase activity to downstream target proteins."

A search of NDEX [23] shows SMARCD1 as a key effector and regulatory protein within the glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network. In protein-protein interaction studies, SMARCD1 complexes with NRC31 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1), a glucocorticoid receptor [28].

This GEM was then improved by incorporating further information, such as organellar location and, crucially, transcriptomic and metabolomic **data** [121]. These models showed how P. infestans growth was dependent on host thiamine biosynthesis. Moreover, separate consideration of the host and oomycete transcriptomic **data** showed how the pathogen increasingly shuts down some of its own biosynthetic pathways, becoming more dependent on host-sourced nutrients.

252622102,18/27,1.0,0.667,"This study has several limitations. First, in contrast to a clinical diagnosis, the CES-D measures past-week depressive symptoms which may vary over time due to the scale's sensitivity to reactions to life events and individual-level cycles of symptomology (Radloff, 1977). However, the CES-D has shown adequate test-retest validity for intervals of up to 12 months (Radloff, 1977) which supports its use in longitudinal studies conducted previously on this topic (Adjibade et al., 2018;Akbaraly et al., 2013;Le Port et al., 2012;Vermeulen et al., 2018). Second, while we included current use of antidepressants in the outcome to indicate depression in the absence of symptoms, there are important limitations to this measure.

Knock-  down of 14-3-3 resulted in increased AQP2 ubiquitylation, decreased AQP2 half-life, and ultimately drastically reduced AQP2 levels. These **data** suggest that 14-3-3 ""protects"" AQP2 from being ubiquitylated and directed into the degradation pathway. The distinct localization of 14-3-3 suggests that this ""protection"" occurs in the apical plasma membrane domain, where otherwise ubiquitylation of AQP2 followed by endocytic retrieval and subsequent degradation is initiated (30). What potential mechanisms could be behind such a response? Previous studies from our group and others have shown that AVPinduced phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser-256 and Ser-269 mediates AQP2 membrane accumulation by decreasing the rate of AQP2 internalization, a process that ultimately results in increased AQP2 protein half-life (23,29). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate one model (Fig. 15) where: 1) upon AVP stimulation AQP2 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser-256 that facilitates its trafficking to the plasma membrane; 2) at the membrane AQP2 undergoes Ser-269 phosphorylation; 3) the individual or combined effect of the two AQP2 phosphorylation events mediates an interaction with 14-3-3; and 4) the AQP2⅐14-3-3 complex prevents or limits binding of an unknown E3 ligase or an adapter protein to AQP2 thus reducing AQP2 ubiquitylation, internalization, and subsequent degradation. In line with this mechanism, mutation of AQP2 at Ser-256 or Ser-269 to alanine resulted in the complete absence, or dramatically reduced interaction of AQP2 with 14-3-3, respectively. Furthermore, AQP2 membrane abundance and Ser-269 phosphorylation were reduced in the 14-3-3 knockdown cells, suggesting a higher rate of internalization. Finally,  .

25460449,6/31,3.0,0.194,"One function of the SG-SSPN subcomplex is to stabilize ␣-DG at the sarcolemma (Holt et al., 1998). By examining extraction of ␣-DG with SDS, we show that disruption of proper SG-SSPN protein interactions within the sarcolemma of SSPN-Tg muscle results in destabilization of ␣-DG. The role of ␣-DG in organization of the extracellular matrix has been well-established (Brown et al., 1999;Henry and Campbell, 1998;Henry et al., 2001;Kanagawa et al., 2005). We now show that SSPN overexpression disrupts formation of the extracellular matrix, as revealed by uncoupling of perlecan, laminin and collagen VI co-localization and as seen by electron microscopy. Laminins represent one of the major components of the extracellular matrix and mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which encodes laminin-␣2 chain, cause congenital MD (Allamand et al., 1997;Helbling-Leclerc et al., 1995;Miyagoe-Suzuki et al., 2000). Although the DGC is normally expressed in mouse models with defects in laminin (dy/dy, dy w /dy w , dy 3k /dy 3k , dy Pas /dy Pas , dy 2j /dy 2j ; dy = Lama2), the linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton is disrupted (Besse et al., 2003;Guo et al., 2003;Kuang et al., 1998;Miyagoe et al., 1997;Sunada et al., 1994;Xu et al., 1994).

Interestingly, in roots drought induced the expression of the same GME gene observed in leaves, along with the VTC2 gene Medtr5g093390, while there was a reduction of the transcript levels of the two VTC1 genes (Supplementary Figure 1).

25826755,8/22,2.0,0.364,"The plasma membrane of contractile smooth muscle cells is highly ordered, consisting of repeating longitudinal rib-like arrays of caveolae and adherens junctions (Gabella, 1984;Halayko and Stelmack, 2005;Montesano, 1979;Small, 1985;Small and Gimona, 1998). These domains are associated with disparate intracellular, membrane-associated and extracellular proteins; for example, adherens junctions are enriched in actin crosslinking proteins such as vinculin, transmembrane integrins and fibronectin in the extracellular basal lamina (Gabella, 1984;North et al., 1993;Small, 1985). North and colleagues (North et al., 1993) provided initial evidence that caveolae microdomains are marked by the presence of both caveolin-1 and dystrophin. This has contributed to models of the cytoskeletal organization in smooth muscle, but there has been no investigation that assesses the mechanisms of colocalization of caveolin-1 and dystrophin, or of the functional relevance of this association. Our new **data** show that several subunits of the DGC, including -dystroglycan, colocalize with caveolin-1 in membrane arrays in contractile myocytes. In striking contrast, in noncontractile cultured cells lacking endogenous -dystroglycan, caveolin-1 is expressed, but is not organized into linear arrays (see Fig. 1D). This suggests a need for the DGC in ordering of membrane caveolae domains, a conclusion supported by the fact that stable silencing of -dystroglycan leads to disruption of caveolae linear arrays and loss of caveolin-1 and PTRF/cavin from lipid-raft-rich membrane fractions. PTRF/cavin is crucial for caveolae formation (Hill et al., 2008), and its presence on the inside surface of caveolae stabilizes these structures, probably through interaction with the cytoskeleton (Liu and Pilch, 2008). Thus, -dystroglycan is required for the organization of caveolae arrays through its interaction with caveolin-1, and this might impact at a more fundamental level the association of PTRF/cavin and its role in forming and stabilizing caveolar structures. These observations are also important in light of our previous studies showing that DGC expression is a feature of contractile phenotype myocytes (Sharma et al., 2008), equipping them with the capacity to organize caveolae into arrays as a determinant of smooth muscle physiology."

253240026,27/31,2.0,0.871,"RT-qPCR **data** ( Figures 7C-H) showed that Ti-treated plants have an enhanced expression of AAO3 and ABI5 when exposed to NaCl, which are critical genes in the ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling respectively (Barrero et al., 2006;Fujita et al., 2011). This enhanced expression is clear one day after transfer to media containing NaCl and is apparently lost after 7 days of the transfer. These results indicate that a higher level of expression of genes involved in the responses to osmotic stress is critical during the early stages of the response to osmotic stress. The finding that expression of PYL4, ABI5, and AAO3 is significantly higher in seedlings grown in media containing NaCl and Ti than in those grown in media containing NaCl without Ti, confirms that Ti activates the expression of genes involved in osmotic stress, but also that to maintain a higher level of expression requires the continuous presence of Ti."

However, the sensitivity of NCA to the connectivity matrix can be estimated by adding or removing connections randomly from the original matrix, and repeating the NCA calculation multiple times [14].

Importantly, although participants were objectively in the same income range, subjective socio-economic status was successfully varied by providing them a fictitious feedback about their relative standing in the social and economic ladder.

With the exception of cheatgrass, which was sometimes found to be more abundant outside of exclosures, differences that were seen in vegetation cover were associated with differences in plant communities and not the presence or absence of grazing. Similar observations have been made in the sagebrush steppe of eastern Oregon where differences in the cover of vascular plants following the cessation of grazing were not observed but the cover and composition of biocrusts differed (Ponzetti & McCune 2001). In western Colorado, reference conditions in the sagebrush steppe, specifically black sagebrush and Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities, were associated with high cover of biocrusts (Shinneman et al. 2008). Our **data** corroborate that relatively higher cover of some biocrust components are indicative of low levels of disturbance in the sagebrush steppe (Condon & Pyke 2018b), and that in arid and semiarid systems in general, species composition is affected by grazing (Hodgins & Rogers 1997)."

SSPN protein expression was not stoichiometric with respect to the other DGC components. This observation suggests that the molar ratio of SSPN to the other DGC components is important and that regulating the levels of SSPN within the myofiber is critical for normal muscle function. Such findings support the hypothesis that SSPN regulates protein interactions within the DGC and that increasing the stoichiometry of SSPN relative to the DGC is highly toxic. Taken together, our **data** are the first to suggest that SSPN may indeed play an important role in muscle physiology. Previous searches for patients with genetic mutations in the SSPN gene have focused on sarcoglycandeficient muscular dystrophies. Despite extensive efforts, SSPN mutations have not been identified in cases of AR-LGMD . In light of the apparent role of SSPN-mediated stability of ␣-DG and the extracellular matrix, the current report provides evidence to suggest that SSPN may also be involved in congenital muscular dystrophies."

Based on the expression **data** of Arabidopsis from PLEXdb (AT40), we found that all Arabidopsis MKK genes are expressed (Fig. 6a). Except AtMKK8, most MKK genes have transcribed in the flowering stage. With the exception of MKK10, the Arabidopsis MKKs have a consensus S/ T-X 5 -S/T in their activation domain. Even MKK10 have an atypical S/T-X 5 -S/T motif show detectable expression, indicating that they possibly have a new function other than becoming silenced. It is interesting that the expression of AtMKK10 is much higher in pollen compared with other tissues. Arabidopsis MKKs genetically exhibit the crosstalk in a variety of signaling pathways, therefore, a single mkk mutant under normal growth conditions is very difficult to obtain a specific phenotype [43]. A previous study showed that the ap1-15, ap2-6, ap3-6, ag-12, clv3-7, lfy-12 and ufo-1 mutants involve with flower development, whereas AtMKK10 was down regulated in these mutants (Fig. 6b), consistent with their expression in the flower. CLV has a potential role in the regulation of meristem size and has little expressed in the center of the meristem [44,45]. The bam (CLV homologs) mutant exhibited rather weak phenotypes and regulated the male gametophyte development, leading to almost completely sterile plants [45]. Therefore, AtMKK10 which is regulated by CLV proteins may participate in the process of pollen development (Fig. 6c)."
2903113,5/11,1.0,0.455,"HEYL Localization Is Altered in Cancer Tissue-We have previously shown that in prostate cancer biopsies HEY1 expression is predominantly cytoplasmic rather than nuclear, and we hypothesized that this cellular localization provides a growth advantage in cancer cells, circumventing the repressive effects of nuclear HEY1 (25,26). To understand better the mechanism(s) of repression of AR by HEY proteins, we examined the subcellular distribution of HEYL protein by confocal microscopy with a monoclonal antibody. In normal and benign transformed prostate epithelial lines, RWPE-1 and BPH-1, respectively, endogenous HEYL was entirely nuclear (Fig. 7A). In our inducible LNCaP:HEYL cell line treated with doxycycline, the exogenously expressed HEYL was also nuclear, demonstrating that the transfected HEYL behaves similarly to endogenous protein, and furthermore, we observed a co-localization of HEYL and AR in the nucleus of these cells in the presence of androgen (Fig. 7A, bottom panel). In addition, we verified the specificity of the HEYL antibody by immunofluorescence and Western blotting of LNCaP:HEYL cells treated with or without doxycycline (Fig. 7A). To examine expression patterns of endogenous HEYL in human prostate tissue, we used prostate needle biopsies from patients with prostate cancer and stained them for HEYL. As shown in Fig. 7B, endogenous HEYL was expressed in the epithelial cell compartment of the prostate and showed nuclear localization in benign cells (Fig. 7B, left panels) with little expression detected in the cytoplasm. However, in all stages of cancer examined, HEYL nuclear intensity decreased, in most cases correlating with increasing cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 7, B and C). The expression score for each patient is plotted in Fig. 7C. This shows that nuclear expression decreased in all stages of the disease studied but remained high in adjacent benign tissue. Furthermore, expression of HEYL in the cytoplasm remained low in adjacent tissue but at the same level or higher in prostate cancer. Collectively, these **data** suggest that HEYL is excluded from the nuclei of cancer cells but not benign cells, indicating that nuclear exclusion of HEYL occurs in the early stages of prostate cancer formation or progression."

Some of the previous publications have also reported about substantial delays in the onset of mortality when treated with antibiotics (e.g., [24]). Notably, however, most of the studies have reported much stronger effects of antibiotics on survival using bacteria-expressed Cry toxins than we observed in our studies with plant-expressed Cry toxins. From our experiments, it is also clear that Bt plant variety significantly influenced survival as well as the interaction between Cry toxin and antibiotics, in particular for the species that exhibited moderate susceptibility, S. littoralis. Both non-Bt control maize varieties were fairly equally suitable as host plants for both lepidopteran species tested, with only minor differences in mortality, regardless of the antibiotic treatment-survival rates never dropped below 80%. However, the Spanish control maize variety was clearly less suitable for rapid weight gain and, thus, optimal development, than the South African maize variety, i.e. irrespective of the Cry toxin. This variety effect seemed to enhance the impact of the Cry toxins in the Spanish Bt maize variety decreasing the observed survival rate of S. littoralis larvae by almost 40% compared to the South African Bt maize. However, the antibiotic treatments buffered this impact significantly on Spanish Bt maize, allowing for about 15-20% higher survival than without antibiotics. This difference was also measurable but less distinct for O. nubilalis with much lower survival rates than S. littoralis on Bt maize. Maize plants are long known to produce insect deterring compounds like Dimboa or lignin (e.g., [35,36]) that likely may exert additional complex effects in combination with the expressed Cry toxins. While host plant resistance factors are well-known and have long been studied in many crop species, also in conjunction with other pest control measures such as pesticides (e.g., [37][38][39][40]), it represents an understudied field with regard to GM plants expressing insecticidal bacterial toxins [5,41]."

During the resting-state, the regions that show a significant brain-behavioral correlation between the total RAPM score and the positive GBC value fit nicely with the four-stage model of the P-FIT: sensory information processing (e.g., cuneus, lingual gyrus and precuneus), integration and abstraction of sensory information (e.g., angular and supramarginal gyrus), hypothesis testing to find a solution for a problem (e.g., MFG), and response selection when the best solution is determined in hypothesis testing (e.g., dACC) 18,19 . Besides, the GBC value of the regions in the DMN, such as the MFG and angular gyrus, is found to be positively associated to the full RAPM score, suggesting that the increased DMN integration during the resting-state may benefit gF 22,23 . Our present study also reveals an association of the MFG and dACC with gF. Previous studies have shown that the MFG and dACC play an important role in the higher-level cognitive processes (when reasoning): relational integration, working memory, and cognitive control 11,15,16 ; therefore, our findings also suggest a possible link between these high-level cognitive processes and gF."

Similar home range sizes between the pup-rearing period and late winter have been more commonly documented (Potvin et al. 1988, Fuller 1989 and are attributed in part to lower pack cohesion (Metz et al. 2011) and rotational foraging patterns (Demma and Mech 2009) during summer. Seasonal pack home range sizes were also larger than those previously reported (Person 2001), which were calculated using both MCPs and kernel density estimators (KDEs). This could be due to either methodological or ecological factors. Our study used GPS radiocollars, whereas Person (2001) used VHF radiocollar **data** collected at longer time intervals (every 5-14 days) to determine home range size. Rarefication of our location **data** to assess the effects of less frequent position fixes on home range size resulted in MCP home ranges that were ~30% smaller and KDE home ranges that were 10-25% larger than our position fix rate (ADF&G unpubl.). However, we also used a method to account for spatial autocorrelation; therefore, due to the underestimation of home range size from standard methods (such as KDEs; Fleming et al. 2015), we would expect the AKDEs to be larger. Because home range sizes have an inverse relationship with habitat quality, prey biomass, and wolf density (Ballard et al. 1987, Fuller et al. 2003, Kittle et al. 2015, the larger home range sizes we reported could also be due to ecological factors, including a decrease in wolf density on POW over the past two decades (Person et al. 1996, Roffler et al. 2016, or ecological changes affecting prey density such as reductions of high-quality winter deer habitat (i.e. low elevation old-growth forests)."

We hypothesize that, during chronic inflammation, NOV downregulation in DRG and spinal cord contributes to MMP-2/-9 induction thereby participating in the maintenance of pain intensity. Because NOV appears as a novel mediator in the functional interplay between cytokine and MMPs in pain processes, it may alone or in concert with other drugs represent a new interesting analgesic. Knowing that recent evidence renders MMP-2/-9 useful targets for neuropathic pain relief [56], the investigation of NOV involvement in neuropathic pain would be worthwhile research, and preliminary **data** from our laboratory in this matter appear promising.

Gene expression analyses obtained from whole blood leukocyte samples provide an integrated signal from different leukocyte populations which are difficult to deconvolute, and so using a single cell population would be advantageous, such as could be obtained using cell sorting or other methods. Additionally, the number of transcription factors which can be used in NCA is approximately the number of expression profiles in the **data** set, and so a greater number of expression profilesobtained at best shortly after the endotoxin administrationwould also have been useful. Finally, NCA's scaling property, which makes it difficult to predict the direction of transcription factor activity, as well as NCA's current inability to incorporate time course information from the **data** set are important limitations to the method.

Venn analysis helped us to determine sets of genes that are common or uniquely upregulated and downregulated at 10 days across the two tested tissues. In the case of upregulated genes, only six genes are shared, whereas 944 and 51 are specific for root and shoot, respectively ( Figure 4A). In the case of downregulated genes, 20 genes were shared, whereas 1257 and 59, were specific for root and shoot, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4, Supplementary Tables S3-S6).

237733208,17/51,1.0,0.333,"Particularly now, the severe hazards that present high risks to humans and the ecosystems are extreme climatic patterns [77]. Hence, with evidence showing that the severity of extreme climatic patterns has increased since the 1990s, these events are under serious consideration and gaining attention. As part of a time series analysis, the recognition of a monotonic trend has prime importance. For applying statistical methods, a speculative composition requires the detection of trends. Due to the repercussions of climate variability, the non-homogeneity in the trends of hydrological series was shown. Statistical tests assist in identifying trends in stochastic or non-random arrangements. Understanding their potential or size permits us to make an accurate decision regarding already present trends [78]. The **data** was analyzed through various procedures, which involved performing tests to detect trends, occurrences, and stationarity of the **data** for the whole Punjab region, the results of which are shown in Table 4.

Both EPA and DHA are effective at lowering triglycerides, although there is evidence that DHA may lower triglycerides more than EPA. Whilst neither omega-3 PUFA alters total cholesterol to a great degree, DHA appears to increase HDL cholesterol, particularly the more cardioprotective HDL 2 subfraction, whilst EPA decreases HDL 3 cholesterol. DHA increases LDL cholesterol more than EPA, and more so in men than in women, and also increases LDL particle size, which may be less atherogenic. From the more limited trial **data** available, DHA may be more effective than EPA at lowering heart rate and blood pressure in normotensive individuals, whilst both EPA and DHA inhibited platelet function but had no effect on fibrinolytic function. Whilst inconsistent findings were reported for the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory markers and glycaemic control, both omega-3 PUFAs were able to lower oxidative stress, which is increased in certain subjects such as diabetics thereby increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease."

Approximately half the genes up regulated in both ATCC 33277 parent and rprY mutant strains under Na + stress were reported to be associated with the OxyR regulon [18]. It was demonstrated that expression of several of these genes was maximal during normal anaerobic growth and were downregulated in an oxyR mutant grown under the same conditions, consistent with OxyR was a positive regulator of these genes [18]. Our **data** show that under Na + stress expression of these genes was higher in the mutant consistent with RprY being a repressor. A possible scenario is that under anaerobic conditions OxyR constitutively activates oxidative stress genes and RprY, acting as a repressor, fine-tunes the expression of a subset of these to maintain a balance that prevents a superoxidative stress response. Sodium depletion disrupts the balance triggering induction of RprY in order to restore homeostasis and eventual growth as in the parent strain. However, in the absence of RprY a superoxidative stress response ensues from which the mutant cannot recover and grow."

244214739,8/15,2.0,0.533,"The striking discrepancies seen for SSTs are amplified in the northern cores, with systematic overestimations obtained with dinocysts, with the reconstructed values being significantly above the modern summer ones. This pattern was also registered during HEs in the northern Bay of Biscay, suggesting that specific environmental conditions, related to the coldest contexts, may generate strong divergences in the sensitivity ranges of the two groups. As previously discussed in references where dinocyst **data** were published (see Table 1), this can be partly explained by their ecological affinities, which can be seen as antagonist when dealing with an organic phytoplanktonic group, i.e., dinocysts, versus a calcareous one, i.e., foraminifera, with the latter grazing on diverse substrates and inhabiting a large depth interval within the water column. As seen in Figure  4, low sea-surface salinities were recorded between 50 and 10 ka, conditions that PF, known to form stenohaline populations, rather avoid (even if the dominant species, NP, tolerates low values [9]). Regarding the mechanisms ruling the water column structure during the last glaciation and especially HEs or stadials, a segregation in space, mainly depth, and time, mainly the season of growth, can be the reason behind the detected discrepancies. Thus, which group has better recorded past events? It is impossible to speculate, given the current limited knowledge available, but incoherencies have to be taken into account when interpreting paleoceanographical and paleoclimatological changes. For the two populations here compared, stratification is probably one of the key parameters; however, the whole set of hydrographical parameters, biological and physical, has to be considered and questioned. Interpretations are further complicated by the fact that none of the parameters are independent. Therefore, additional new reconstructions, such as those we propose with this article, are useful, as they enlarge the set of variables to be tested. It could be argued that this introduces more instability to the debate; on the contrary, we claim that it raises important fundamental questions and new ways for researchers to better monitor past environments."

7894599,18/26,4.0,0.692,"By EMSA we established that RprY binds to the promoter regions of groES, dnaK and clpB. We reasoned that Na + -depletion caused oxidation of metabolites and proteins, and induction of RprY. Parent cells mount a stress response that included activation of OxyR regulated genes, e.g. superoxide dismutase [25] and repression of RprY-regulated genes, e.g. ahpCF [9] as well as heat shock proteins and chaperones to protect cells from protein oxidation and misfolding. The transcription **data** suggests that RprY acts as a repressor of dnaK, groESL and clpB which may help the parent adapt to Na + stress. In the mutant lacking RprY, groESL, dnaK and clpB expression cannot be repressed which may contribute to the growth defect upon Na + -depletion. The expression of heat shock proteins is tightly controlled by both positive and negative regulation [36,37]. The expression of several of HSP chaperones is maintained at basal levels by mechanisms that include negative feedback loops [38] and blocking of promoters by CIRCE sequences and negative regulators [39]. Positive regulation is achieved by expression of alternate sigma factors [36]. Thus HSP expression is tightly coordinated with cell requirements during stress and non-stress conditions to ensure survival. Analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis HSP promoter regions did not identify the classic CIRCE sequences required for negative regulation, leading to the assumption that Porphyromonas may utilize different control mechanisms."

Protein binding specificity was determined by adding 50-100X excess unlabeled probe to the reaction mixes. In these experiments the ahpC and sod promoters were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, as we previously showed that ahpC, but not sod, was a target of RprY [9]. By EMSA we showed that RprY bound to the promoter regions of groES, clpB and dnaK, but did not bind to the promoter region of htpG (Fig. 6B)."
217125084,8/57,1.0,0.14,"A previous study showed that MKK8 and MKK10 have not expressed in shoot apices (including flower buds), mesophyll cells, mature leaves [26] and flowers  (including developing young siliques) [42]. Based on the expression **data** of Arabidopsis from PLEXdb (AT40), we found that all Arabidopsis MKK genes are expressed (Fig. 6a). Except AtMKK8, most MKK genes have transcribed in the flowering stage. With the exception of MKK10, the Arabidopsis MKKs have a consensus S/ T-X 5 -S/T in their activation domain. Even MKK10 have an atypical S/T-X 5 -S/T motif show detectable expression, indicating that they possibly have a new function other than becoming silenced. It is interesting that the expression of AtMKK10 is much higher in pollen compared with other tissues. Arabidopsis MKKs genetically exhibit the crosstalk in a variety of signaling pathways, therefore, a single mkk mutant under normal growth conditions is very difficult to obtain a specific phenotype [43]. A previous study showed that the ap1-15, ap2-6, ap3-6, ag-12, clv3-7, lfy-12 and ufo-1 mutants involve with flower development, whereas AtMKK10 was down regulated in these mutants (Fig. 6b), consistent with their expression in the flower. CLV has a potential role in the regulation of meristem size and has little expressed in the center of the meristem [44,45]. The bam (CLV homologs) mutant exhibited rather weak phenotypes and regulated the male gametophyte development, leading to almost completely sterile plants [45]. Therefore, AtMKK10 which is regulated by CLV proteins may participate in the process of pollen development (Fig. 6c)."

251711372,38/119,1.0,0.319,"While our study provides insightful implications, it is important to keep in mind its limitations. A key ingredient in an event study involves the date(s). Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination. We are aware that the magnitude of the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness announcements was influenced by the chosen dates."

7894599,15/26,3.0,0.577,"To further verify that Na + depletion induces an oxidative stress response of P. gingivalis, we carried out comparative analyses of small metabolites formed in parent and rprY mutant cells grown (2 hr) in the presence and absence of Na + . The **data** was analyzed in several ways including differences between parent and mutants strains in normal medium; in Na + -depleted medium; and metabolites that responded to Na + stress in parent or mutant. The p-values obtained from Two-Way ANOVA statistical analyses indicated whether differences were due to the effect of the rprY mutation or to Na + stress or both. Accordingly, as seen in Table 3, certain significant effects appeared to relate to the sodium status, e.g., in Na + stress, higher methionine sulfoxide, lower ketosphingosine, and more of certain dipeptides. Other effects appeared more related to RprY function than to Na + , e.g., in the mutant, higher undecanoate and lower thiamine. While it is difficult to make close connections of these changes with physiology (see Discussion), we here observe only that this initial analysis of a large number of metabolites from biosynthesis, catabolism and central metabolism reveals perturbations in relatively few of them in the four situations examined. Finally, we compared growth of a P. gingivalis oxyR mutant with that of the parent strain in Na + -depleted and normal media. As observed previously, the parent strain was able to grow in the Na +depleted medium while the oxyR mutant could not (Fig. 5), similar to the rprY mutant (Fig. 2). Since OxyR is a master regulator of genes involved in oxidative stress in Gram-negative bacteria [18], we infer that Na + depletion causes oxidative stress in the P. gingivalis cells."

Figure 5B depicts sharp increase in the production of IL-1β, -8, -6, and TNF-α within 24 h of treatment of naïve HBCA cells with UV-inactivated supernatant from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells when normalized with those treated with UVinactivated supernatant from mock-infected SK-N-SH cells. We then analyzed the amount of these cytokines released in naïve HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from SK-N-SH cells and compared it to the kinetics of cytokine production by HBCA cells directly infected with WNV (MOI-1). In accordance with the mRNA data, the release of IL-1β, -6, -8 and TNF-α from HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells was comparatively much higher than those treated with mock-infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant after 24 and 48 h as measured by ELISA (p < 0.05, Figure 6). It was interesting to note that all cytokines produced by WNV-infected HBCA cells were not significantly high at 24 hr after infection and a sharp increase occurred only at 48 h after infection, (Figure 6) which coincided with the peak in virus replication [31]. Furthermore, infection of astrocytes with only UVinactivated WNV (MOI-1) did not induce the expression of aforementioned cytokines at any time point (Figure 6) thus ruling out the contribution of UV-inactivated WNV in inducing this effect on HBCA cells. These **data** collectively demonstrate that the supernatant derived from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line is capable of activating HBCA cells.  "
253240026,26/31,1.0,0.839,"Our results showed that the content of S, P, Cu, Na, Zn, Mn, Fe, and K is higher in the shoot of Ti-treated Arabidopsis plants than in the untreated control ( Figure 3C). These **data** are similar to those reported for other plant species showing that Ti enhances the accumulation of different elements in plant tissues (Konishi and Tsuge, 1936;Carvajal and Alcaraz, 1995;Frutos et al., 1996;Wojcik and Wojcik, 2001;Hrubýet al., 2002;Alcaraz-Lopez et al., 2004;Haghighi et al., 2012;Kleiber and Markiewicz, 2013;Servin et al., 2013;Daghan et al., 2020;Ghazi et al., 2021). The increase of the content of essential elements in Ti-treated Arabidopsis plants correlates well with our RNA-seq **data** that shows that several genes encoding N, K, S, and divalent cations transporters, as well as P-starvation responsive genes are activated by Ti treatment ( Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S5). The enhanced Pi content and the reduction in the uptake of toxic elements such as Al, and Cd could be explained by the increased expression of genes encoding organic acid transporters in Titreated plants. Organic acid exudation has been shown to enhance Pi uptake and ameliorate Al toxicity by preventing its entry into the root (Hocking, 2001;Barcelóand Poschenrieder, 2002;Santos et al., 2014). Our **data** shows that the root exudates of Ti-treated plants have a higher capacity to solubilize Pi from insoluble compounds and higher chelation of metallic ions (Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggest that treatment with 2 mM Ti enhances plant nutrition which is reflected in better growth. However, as we described before, higher Ti concentrations (8 mM) have a drastic effect on Arabidopsis growth, which could be due to a direct toxic effect of Ti or an indirect effect mediated by an exacerbated accumulation of some elements in the plant such as Na or Fe. According to White and Brown (2010), Na, Cl, B, Fe, and Mn are toxic at high concentrations. Considering that in Ti-treated plants the increased Pi accumulation was directly correlated with the amount of Ti applied ( Figure 1C, D), other elements may be hyperaccumulated at high Ti concentrations. This elemental hyperaccumulation could be responsible, at least in part, of the toxic effect of Ti at high concentrations."

196543150,13/17,2.0,0.765,"Currently, there is a lack of validation studies to bring source space connectivity into clinical practice. Even M/EEG source localization is still only performed in a modest number of centers worldwide, e.g., in the E-PILEPSY consortium electromagnetic source localization is only used at 12 out of 25 centers in the presurgical evaluation (85). Calculating source space connectivity is more complex than source localization alone. Given that the integration of source localization has already proven to be difficult in clinical practice, it can be anticipated that this will be an even larger challenge for source space connectivity. First, well designed prospective studies should show that source space connectivity has clear added value compared to the visual analysis of the electrophysiologist today on a patient specific level. Later, the methods should be available in standardized software with appropriate clearance for clinical use. Software for clinical use must come along with high usability, so that clinical-technical staff can do the necessary steps of processing (a) without risk of running into pitfalls that are common in source imaging and (b) within a workable time range, which is notoriously limited in clinical contexts. Next to this, standardized paradigms must be defined and tested, similarly to neuropsychological tests, in order to determine whether eloquent areas can be mapped by source connectivity analysis in pre-surgical evaluation. These paradigms must take into account the fact that network analyses require temporal information. Indeed, source-level connectivity needs different **data** properties than simple source-transformation of single events such as peaks of event related components. Only when all these limitations are overcome, can source connectivity be considered in clinical practice to assist in patient treatment and follow-up."
220474872,29/49,1.0,0.592,"It was thought that Gal1 secreted from large tumours induces T cell apoptosis and switches to Th2 cytokine production. However, recent **data** suggests that Gal1 conditions the tumour endothelial cells by inducing expressions of PD-L1 and Gal9 and suppresses anti-tumour immunity by causing T cell exclusion, which in fact takes place relatively earlier during tumour growth [207]. Thus, any lack of successes in anti-PD-1 treatment, whereby patients eventually develop progressive disease, may be due to Gal1-induced immune-evasion and addressed by introducing anti-Gal1 antibody in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment. Indeed, Gal1 blockade enhanced the effect of anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical models of head and neck cancers [207]. Therefore, this strategy of blocking Gal1 in combination with anti-cancer immunotherapies should be investigated further and introduced in clinical studies."

Indeed scalp EEG **data** can be decomposed into alternating stable scalp voltage topographies called ""microstates, "" (75). Future connectivity studies of the resting-state might gain from considering the different microstates separately. In these future studies, oversimplification of microstates to a few basic configurations is not recommendable. Larger scale evaluation of generalizability of microstates is first needed before choosing a set of pre-defined resting-state patterns. Moreover, comparison of microstates to the time-restricted view of source space connectivity is of interest, as time scale plays an important role in determining directed networks."

Although DmGSTO1 null mutants showed a normal muscle phenotype, park 1 /DmGSTO1 null double mutants showed dramatically enhanced degeneration of IFMs compared with park 1 single mutants (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, overexpression of DmGSTO1A using a ubiquitous driver, Tub-Gal4, suppressed the degeneration of IFMs in park 1 mutants. Overexpression of DmGSTO1A in park 1 mutants resulted in regular and compact muscle tissues in the dorsal longitudinal IFMs, which were similar to those of wild type flies except for occasional vacuoles (Fig. 2E).

We also were able to identify additional genes that could be included in our model, notably 36 which had less initial evidence, but were substantiated by our predictions. Given that there were 1,215 genes with significant changes in gene expression for which regulatory relations were known, we were therefore able to capture between 8% (= 99 initial model genes/1,215 genes with significant expression changes and known regulatory relations) and 11% (99 + 36 additional genes = 135/1,215) of the explainable response. Furthermore, we were also able to identify new target genes based on the average gene expression profile of significant clusters, which could expand the scope of our temporal network still further. With a larger network reconstruction and **data** set specifically designed for use with NCA, it might be possible to move toward a nearcomplete characterization of dynamic transcription responses."

Schematic diagram showing a pathogenetic mechanism for SSPN-mediated disruption of the DGC. The **data** in the current report support a model of SSPNinduced dysfunction of the DGC. We propose that SSPN (green) overexpression at the sarcolemma (1) causes clustering of the SGs (yellow) into insoluble aggregates (2). Perturbation of the SG-SSPN subcomplex within the DGC impairs its ability to properly anchor ␣-DG (red) at the sarcolemma (3). The destabilization of ␣-DG attachment to the sarcolemma leads to perturbation of basement membrane (blue) assembly (4). It is feasible that disruption of the basement membrane leads to aberrant cellular signaling (5), which may be responsible for the increased levels of apoptosis in phenotypic SSPN-Tg mice. By this pathogenetic mechanism, SSPN disrupts protein interactions within and across the membrane bilayer leading to a severe phenotype that is reminiscent of congenital MD."

53478339,15/24,1.0,0.625,"There has been considerable discussion of the differences observed in Sr/Ca-SST relationships, and the potential causes of the differing equations obtained (Corrège, 2006;Gagan et al., 2000). Common factors cited are the effects of coral physiology, growth rate dependence, and regional differences (Grove et al., 2013a;Moustafa et al., 2000). Ayling et al. (2006) summarized Sr/Ca-SST and δ-SST relationships obtained from corals at a global level and found average proxy SST slope relationships of −0.166‰/°C (−0.15 to −0.20‰/°C) for δ 18 O and −0.065 mmol/ mol (−0.0469 to −0.079 mmol/mol) for Sr/Ca. While similar to this range of values from the Indo-Pacific region, the intercept and slope of the proxy SST equations obtained here from King Reef are lower than those found in several previous studies from the GBR (e.g. Gagan et al., 1998;Marshall and McCulloch, 2002). This difference may be because of the nearshore location of the sampled modern microatoll. The location of the most inshore record previously obtained is Pandora reef, which is ~ 20 km offshore (Gagan et al., 1994), in comparison with ~ 1 km for the modern microatoll in this study. The value may also be influenced by the microatoll growth form of the While some previous studies have noted a greater SST range obtained from coral proxy SST records in the mid-Holocene (Moustafa et al., 2000;Sun et al., 2005), these were based solely on δ 18 O records, and therefore may be affected by changes in precipitation. The King Reef microatoll Sr/Ca records in this study, influenced primarily by SST, find a significantly smaller annual Sr/Ca annual range in the mid-Holocene. Recent climate modeling and Pacific sediment core **data** also indicate a reduced SST seasonality resulting from an attenuated ENSO influence in the mid-Holocene (Clement et al., 1999;Koutavas et al., 2006;Luan et al., 2012)."

249993992,22/61,1.0,0.361,"It has been well documented that ethylene accumulation is a key signal for flooding. Our transcriptome **data** show that several ethylene biosynthesis genes, such as S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACCO), were upregulated in the submerged roots. These results agree with previous studies showing that waterlogging stress promotes ethylene biosynthesis [52]. However, although ethylene biosynthesis genes were upregulated, waterlogging stress did not affect the downstream genes in the ethylene pathway, such as ETR, CTR1, and EIN3. Furthermore, although the increased EBF transcription could lead to EIN3 inhibition, this inhibition did not decrease the transcription of ERF TFs. Hence, we speculate that an EIN3-independent pathway might be involved in activating ERF TF transcription since there is growing evidence of the EIN3/EIL1-independent mediated pathway in the ethylene pathway. For example, the double knockout ein3ein1 Arabidopsis mutants were able to respond to ethylene under stress [53]. However, further studies are required to verify this."

Pair-wise correlation tests on expression between genes within a cluster showed significantly higher average correlation than random clusters (Table 2).

Importantly, clustering by transcription strength can identify new clusters unobtainable by clustering the expression **data** alone. For example, Cluster F and G could not be distinguished when the same clustering method was applied to the gene expression **data** alone ( Figure 3B).

However, the distances between sarcolemma of adjacent myofibers appeared to be greater in the SSPN-Tg muscle compared with non-Tg controls (white arrows, Fig. 9A,B).

By contrast, the extracellular matrix from non-Tg muscle appeared to be a tight, linear structure that was closely aligned in a parallel fashion with the sarcolemma (Fig. 9B). The disorganization of the basement membrane in SSPN-Tg muscle may account for the larger spacing between neighboring myofibers.

Interaction of -dystroglycan with caveolin-1 is required to organize membrane caveolae enriched in key GPCR effectors and caveolae-stabilizing proteins. This appears to be crucial for effective spatial organization of caveolae arrays with respect to Ca 2+ -mobilizing effectors and machinery, thus revealing a new role for the actin cytoskeleton as a determinant of smooth muscle function. Collectively, our **data** suggest that interaction of caveolin-1, dystroglycan and the actin cytoskeleton is important for the structural and spatial distribution of membrane caveolae, and has a key role in G q -and PLC-1 mediated Ca 2+ mobilization in the cell."

FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor independent of cyclophilin A, has no activity. Moreover, an NFAT inhibitor is not active. Altogether, these **data** suggest that cyclosporins are potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells.

However, the enzymatic activity of Cyclophilin A is likely dispensable because TMN355 was inactive. Strikingly, the activities of all of these drugs are similar in the two cell lines, suggesting that the activity is cell-type independent, inhibiting the same target using the same mechanism of action. To further support a dependence on cyclophilin in the human respiratory tract, we tested two additional models: iPSC-derived AT2 cells and primary human bronchial epithelial cells.

After promising in vitro studies which showed success in targeting CD19− escape B-ALL cells, in vivo mouse models were used to investigate the efficacy of CD19/20/22 CAR T cell therapy on targeting CD19+ and CD19− escape malignancies. Treatments of CD19/20/22 CAR T cells showed significant anti-tumour response in both mouse models with CD19+ B-ALL as well as the CD19− escape B-ALL which CD19 CAR T cells was ineffective at treating alone [24]. This method presents an exciting branch of CAR T cell therapy for haematological B cell malignancies which do not express CD19."

Together, the preceding **data** suggest that when reagents cannot be individually tested against a gold standard, strong correlation to a paired reagent on another platform, the presence of a cis pQTL, or a significant association with a clinical trait can highlight the accuracy or value of a given reagent.

Intracellular cAMP responses were measured by radioimmunoassay after 15-min exposures at 37°C to concentrations of rPTH(1-34) from 10 Ϫ7 to 10 Ϫ11 M. In A, cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm 2 and grown for 60 h. PTH stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in both ROS (thick solid line) and bG (thick dashed line). However, PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in RCx4 (thin solid line) and RCx16 (thin dashed line) was dramatically attenuated. The peak cAMP response to 10 Ϫ7 M rPTH(1-34) in RCx4 and RCx16 was only 26.2 and 21.9% of that of ROS, respectively. In B, the intracellular cAMP response of ROS (thin solid line) and bG (thin dashed line) plated at 5-10,000 cells/cm 2 and grown for 48 h are shown.

12094753,10/14,1.0,0.714,"With an emphasis on the class of cinnamyol, dihydrocinnamoyl, and benzoyl anthranilates, we illustrate in this study the possibility of producing numerous chemically diverse molecules using biological synthesis rather than conventional chemical synthesis. Our **data** imply that the promiscuity of 4CL5 allows the catalytic conversion of a great diversity of dihydrocinnamates, benzoates, and various cinnamates into the corresponding acyl-CoA-thioesters. To our doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0138972.g004 Table 3. Structural characteristics of the benzoyl anthranilates (general structure shown in Fig 1C) Table 3.  Our original attempts to co-express HCBT with known bacterial benzoyl:CoA ligases for the production of benzoyl anthranilates in yeast were unsuccessful, possibly due to the high pH optima (pH > 8.5) of these enzymes [36,37]. Nevertheless, using the 4CL5 enzyme, we demonstrate the feasibility of producing a substantial diversity of benzoyl-CoA thioesters and benzoate conjugate molecules in yeast. This discovery opens new possibilities for the heterologous combinatorial production of valuable benzoylated metabolites such as benzylbenzoates; benzophenones; the anticancer drug taxol; polyketides with antimicrobial activities (e.g., wailupemycin, enterocin, soraphen A); and unnatural polyketides using engineered benzoyl-CoAdependent polyketide synthases [38]. Furthermore, heterologously synthesized benzoyl anthranilates can be used as scaffolds for the synthesis of related anti-adenoviral compounds and oncogene inhibitors [39,40]. We observed the activity of 4CL5 towards various dihydrocinnamates and non-natural halogenated cinnamates and exploited its catalytic property to biosynthesize libraries of nonnatural and structurally diverse cinnamoyl and dihydrocinnamoyl anthranilates using HCBT. For example, the drug DHavnD was synthesized, and utilization of alternate precursors resulted in the rapid production of 27 additional DHavnD analogs. These results point towards the eventual design of more biologically active drugs through the addition of halogens. They also illustrate the advantage of biological synthesis to achieve bifunctionalization, as exemplified by several of our bi-halogenated compounds. Finally, through co-expression with the adequate synthases, the capacity of 4CL5 to activate dihydrocinnamates creates the potential for biomanufacture of valuable natural products, such as the antibacterial dihydrocinnamoyl forms of flavans and chalcones [41,42]."
280802,16/21,1.0,0.762,"In summary, our **data** demonstrate neurons as an essential responder to innate immune response to WNV and one of the potential sources of cytokines in brain. Considerable efforts are currently directed on targeting proinflammatory cytokines as novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [19,43]. In vitro as well as in vivo studies have established that attenuating the cytokine production in brain directly correlates to improved disease outcome in virus infection [14,16,51,52] and in neurological disease models such as EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS) [13,17]. Broad spectrum and specific anti-inflammatory drugs such as IL-1ra and TACE-inhibitors are recommended as adjunct therapy to control disease progression of various neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke, cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and MS [17,19]. Currently there is no WNV vaccine for humans and once the virus enters the brain, nothing much can be done. Therefore, the significance of our studies lies in delineating specific cell types and downstream pathways associated with cytokine production in WNV-infected brain, and lay a framework for future in vivo studies using mouse model to test the ability of anti-IL and TNF drugs to improve WNV disease outcome.

237305738,13/19,3.0,0.684,"To echo this last point, one of the main challenges of metabolomics in plant pathology is distinguishing plant and microbial metabolomes [80]. Metabolites, most particularly primary compounds, are often ubiquitous in the diverse plant, microbial and animal organisms, or exchanged between the host and pathogens, as signals or metabolic responses. In pathological studies (Figure 1), plants and microbes are jointly incubated, but the pathogens are rarely removed before metabolite extraction, thereby mixing metabolomes of different origins. This probably seems to be of minor importance for other omics, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, which exploit species-specific databases. However, metabolomics suffers from cross-contamination of the host and non-host metabolites; therefore, it is often difficult to draw precise conclusions as to the origin of the metabolic variations found. Whilst one can search **data** for metabolites of non-plant origin, for example, arachidonic acid with respect to fungal pathogens, one cannot assume that their absence suggests that metabolites of fungal origin are not being detected. Implementing stable isotope labelling of microbes could address this pressing concern. A recent metabolomics study of the early stage of plant cell-microbe interactions employed an incubation method of 13 C-and 15 N-labelled (98%) Pst DC3000 with Arabidopsis cells, followed by a washing step to remove the excess bacterial cells [169]. Subsequently, ""light"" plant metabolites were analyzed by targeted LC-MS, highlighting an infection reprogramming of plant signaling and primary metabolic pathways, including carbohydrates, nucleotides, and amino and organic acids. Alternatively, uniformly 13 C-and 15 N-labelled plants can be prepared, which will offer an accurate tool for metabolomic analysis under biotic stress conditions [170]. The growing interest in isotopically labelled biological material coincides with the development of additional analytical tools, such as NMR and high-throughput GC-and LC-HRMS, which allow the discrimination between native and labelled metabolites ( Figure 3). It is conceivable that elegant studies of this type will be carried out less sporadically, to help clarify the origin of changes in the host and pathogen metabolome. In summary, future prospects that will greatly contribute to the success of metabolomics in the study of plant immunity will include (i) increasing the capacity to chromatopgraphically resolve and annotate plant and pathogen metabolomes, (ii) new tools and approaches to analyze the metabolome at the subcellular level, and (iii) the development and implementation of modelling, to predict and/or calculate the dynamics of metabolic variations."
3789137,19/23,2.0,0.826,"Although previous works showed that SYK accumulated in the cytoplasm in RB cells (Zhang et al. 2012), our immunofluorescent staining results showed SYK expression on the cell surface. SYK protein localization on the cell membrane facilitates activated CTLs to specifically recognize the antigens present on the surface of RB-Y79 cells. This is key for specific lymphocyte-based immunotherapy. SYK is also a member of a family of cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This confers an additional advantage for its use in targeted cell immunotherapy because RB-Y79 cells express the SYK protein on the cell surface, allowing it to be recognized by cytotoxic immune cells, while hematopoietic cells, which express cytoplasmic SYK, may be protected from SYK-driven immune cytotoxic activity (Chauhan et al. 2016). Although we demonstrated SYK gene expression in SYK-DCs by qRT-PCR, we failed to detect SYK protein on the surface of infected DC cells using flow cytometry (data not shown). The possible reasons why we failed to detect the SYK signal in DCs could due to two aspects. Firstly, in a classical pathway in DCs, the antigen is cleaved into peptides by endosomal proteases, particularly cathepsin S, and bound by class I molecules probably in the endocytic compartment itself (Rock and Shen 2005). Secondly, the processed antigen could not be presented everlastingly on the DC surface, published **data** have also explained how duration of antigen presentation affects the dynamics of T-cell-DC interactions and consequently determine immune response (Benson et al. 2015). Thus, it is easy to understand why we see no staining for SYK on the pulsed DCs."

Neurotoxic molecules from WNV-infected astrocytes have been demonstrated to induce indirect toxicity in un-infected neurons in vitro [11]. Our recent **data** demonstrating the disruption of tight junctions of the BBB by MMPs released from WNV-infected astrocytes further confirms the role of astrocytes in WNV pathogenesis [31].

The major riverine influence is the Tully River, which enters the GBR lagoon ~ 40 km to the south of King Reef and has an average annual discharge of 3.0 (±0.9) million megaliters. Flood plume movements of the Tully are noted as being variable because of wind and local topographic effects dominating plume fate during lower discharges (King et al., 2001).

Waterlogging affects changes in plant cells, such as limitation of gas diffusion, nutrient depletion, and increased ROS production. To respond and adapt to waterlogging, banana plants have evolved to rapidly elongate their adventitious roots and aerenchyma formation and activate the antioxidant defense system. Our **data** revealed transcriptional changes in the downstream components of hormone signaling and carbon and energy metabolisms during waterlogging. produce energy for cell survival. Indeed, PDC and ADH were upregulated in waterlogged bananas. Pyruvate generated from glycolysis is metabolized to ethanol via PDC and ADH. This process releases energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to increase the chances of plant survival in the absence of aerobic respiration. Genes associated with the TCA, such as glutamate synthase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and glutamate carboxylase, were downregulated in the roots of waterlogged banana plants. This finding concurred with the study by Ren et al. [60], where the authors showed that the activity of GS and GDH was reduced in the stems and leaves of waterlogged maize. The changes in carbon metabolism are often accompanied by changes in nitrogen metabolism to maintain the carbon-nitrogen balance. The increase of amino acid catabolism is required to compensate for the insufficient energy supply during stress. This can be seen in the waterlogged banana roots, where the alanine biosynthesis gene (alanine aminotransferase; AlaAT) was upregulated. Alanine is a carbon and nitrogen source, and its biosynthesis is crucial for plants to survive waterlogging [61]. These results suggest that activation of amino acid catabolism and alcohol fermentation are vital to fulfilling the energy demand in plants under waterlogging stress."
253240026,27/31,1.0,0.871,"Gene expression profiling revealed that Ti elicits in Arabidopsis a transcriptional response at multiple levels by upregulating genes involved with defense and tolerance responses to abiotic and biotic stresses that eventually might lead plants to thrive under such stress conditions. Under stress, plants must cope with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may lead to DNA, protein, lipid, pigment, carbohydrate, and cellular oxidation/damage (Møller et al., 2007;Miller et al., 2010;Golldack et al., 2014). It has been shown that plants subjected to NaCl stress and treated with Ti, have reduced levels of ROS than plants treated with NaCl only, probably because Ti treatment upregulates antioxidant enzymes genes (Abdel Latef et al., 2018;Gohari et al., 2020). Our transcriptomic **data** showed that Titreated plants have increased transcription of genes encoding peroxidases as well as 30 upregulated DEGs corresponding to the GO category response to oxidative stress in roots (Top 54 GO term, p = 0.00635, Supplementary Table S7).

This **data** is in agreement with previous reports that mention that Ti application enhances the activity of ROS copping enzymes (Bacilieri et al., 2017). We also find enriched GO terms in the Ti treatments related to reactive nitrogen species (RNS), specifically nitric oxide (NO) (GO terms, cellular response to nitric oxide GO:0071732 & nitric oxide biosynthetic process GO:0006809, p = >0.05, Supplementary  Table S7), which is the most abundant RNS in plants, and play a critical role orchestrating, responses related to biotic and abiotic stresses (Sańchez-Vicente et al., 2019)."

233192205,4/21,1.0,0.19,"Our **data** thus far clearly point to PIKfyve playing a role in the process of tau seeding in neurons. In order to explore this, we decided to further characterize K18 PFFs uptake and internalization following PIKfyve inhibition. Using K18 PFFs labeled with the pH-insensitive AF488, the number of K18 or FL Tau PFF-positive vesicles in primary hippocampal neurons was to our surprise not altered at 100 nM or 1 μM YM-201636 treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). These results seemed at first to be counterintuitive given our previous **data** using pHrodo labeled K18 PFFs that suggested reduced internalization. To address this conundrum, we tested if pharmacological inhibition of PIKfyve would reduce K18-pHrodo signal as we observed using the knockdown approach. Similar to PIKfyve knock-down, treatment of primary hippocampal neurons with YM-201636 displayed a dose-dependent reduction in K18-pHrodo signal (Fig. 5, C and D). Since the pHrodo signal is not only dependent on neuronal internalization of a labeled substrate but also on the transport into low-pH compartments, we evaluated intracellular acidification using LysoTracker. Interestingly, YM-201636 treatment did not show a decrease, but rather an increase in LysoTracker intensity at concentrations up to 1 μM before reducing due to toxicity (Fig. 5F). These **data** show that the reduction in K18-pHrodo signal is not due to impaired acidification but instead suggest that K18 PFFs are retained in nonacidic vesicles in the endosomal pathway. In support of this notion, PIKfyve inhibition has been linked to an intracellular vesicular phenotype consisting in enlarged endosomes, caused by the reduced maturation of MVB into lysosomes as well as lysosomal recycling (52,53). Indeed, when we treated primary hippocampal neurons with 1 μM YM-201636, we noticed a decrease in the number of LAMP1-positive organelles but an increase in their size, supported by 3D imaging and in line with previous reports (54, 55) (Figs. 5E and S8). Similar findings can be observed in HEK293T cells following 30 min treatment with 1 μM YM-201636, pointing to a cell-typeindependent phenotype (Fig. S9). These **data** suggest that the reduction in K18 PFFs internalization previously seen with Rac1 inhibition is carried out by a mechanism that is PIKfyveindependent, while PIKfyve could be important for the fate of the seed once internalized."

A microatoll inferred to be of mid-Holocene age based on its elevation relative to modern microatolls (later confirmed by dating) was labeled 'KR-AMA-2' and was sampled by cutting a slab 1.4 m in length, approximately 8 cm in width, and ranging from 6 to 10 cm in height, through the major growth axis of the colony (Supplementary Figure 1, available online). An 8-cm slab was also cut through a modern Porites microatoll labeled 'KR-MMA-1', growing near the contemporary reef edge in a comparable habitat. The void left by sampling was replaced with a customized concrete block to minimize visual disturbance and the potential of exposing the corals to additional bioerosion.

Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021).

The transcription profiling **data** uncovered that M. bovis infection repressed a series of gene expressions in EBL cells, which are mainly related to metabolic process and immune response. Intriguingly, many marker genes in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway showed down-regulation after M. bovis infection, suggesting that M. bovis inhibits mTOR signaling in EBL cells. Further evidence showed that M. bovis infection inhibits expression of mTOR signaling pathway marker genes in EBL cells, which are time dependent. Consistently, a previous study reported that M. bovis inhibits autophagy via a PI3K-Akt-mTOR-dependent pathway [17], which also showed that mTOR signal was stimulated at 6 h after M. bovis infection, but gradually decreased after 12 h. The mTOR signaling pathway coordinates eukaryotic cell growth and metabolism with environmental inputs, including nutrients and growth factors, and exerts an essential role in regulating cell nutrition metabolism [8,22]. This study employed FBS as a supplement of exogenous nutrients and found that the addition of a high concentration of FBS can rescue M. bovis-induced cell damage. In addition, a high concentration of FBS can rescue downregulated mTOR signaling, including increasing transcriptional expression and protein phosphorylation level of mTOR pathway marker genes. This study demonstrated that M. bovis infection leads to inhibition of the nutrient metabolic pathway mTOR in a timedependent manner, which gives us the enlightenment that activation of the host mTOR signal pathway can antagonize M. bovis infection. This study would be helpful for people to develop new efficient anti-mycoplasma strategies targeting mTOR signaling via activating mTOR pathway effectors."

UPR activation has been observed in DA neurons of PD patients and is exemplified by an increase in phospho-PERK and eIF2␣ (35). To determine whether the parkin mutation induces UPR activation, we examined eIF2␣, which is one of the components of the UPR signaling pathway and is activated by the upstream kinase PERK (36). The level of active phospho-eIF2␣ was highly increased in park 1 mutants and dramatically restored by DmGSTO1A expression (Fig. 3F). The ER and mitochondrial UPR share similar pathways that increase chaperone levels to promote protein homeostasis in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (37).

Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination. We are aware that the magnitude of the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness announcements was influenced by the chosen dates."

As IGF-II targets the igf2r to lysosomal degradation, mutations in the genes encoding either the receptor (Igf2r) or its ligand (Igf2) will affect the activity of the other, and result in a reduced endosomal trafficking of hydrolases necessary for reovirus disassembly [24].

Firstly, the proposed methods can also be applied to other regions, especially when the **data** of construction waste are insufficient. Secondly, this study not only estimated the carbon emission of recycling activities (environmental cost) but considered the equivalent amount of carbon emissions generated from alternative materials (environmental benefit), which is more in line with practice.

Thirdly, this study estimated the total carbon emission of construction waste recycling in Shanghai from 2022 to 2031. Obtaining such **data** would help decision makers to set up more scientific management strategies and the action plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030 from the aspect of improving the recycling rate of construction waste and usage rate of recycled materials, which could further contribute to the achievement of China's 2060 carbon neutral goal by focusing on one of the most important economic regions: Shanghai City. However, this study has three main limitations. The first limitation is the assumptions. For example, the production of mortar waste recycling is not ignored, thereby affecting the accuracy of the results. The second limitation is that only the construction waste generated from new construction activities are quantified in this research. If other types of waste, such as demolition waste, construction clay and mud, are considered, then the carbon emission will be higher. The third one is that this study does not compare the outcomes with other disposals, such as traditional landfill practice. If such comparisons can be done, then it could provide decision makers with a clearer understanding of the carbon-saving potential generated from recycling construction waste.

Because this was not observed when K18 PFFs were labeled with the pH-insensitive dye AF488, we hypothesized that the Rac1 effector PIKfyve likely exerts its role downstream of K18 PFFs neuronal uptake, i.e., in routing internalized seeds toward lysosomes. The same results were obtained using FL Tau, thus giving strength to our hypothesis. PIKfyve is reported to be a critical regulator in the homeostasis of the endolysosomal system, among others in the reformation of lysosomes from endolysosomes, as is evidenced by the dramatic vacuolization of endosomal compartments when PIKfyve activity is inhibited (53,60,61). Our **data** show that in these circumstances, K18 PFFs stop being transported toward existing lysosomes and are most likely being entrapped in endosomes before being sorted to lysosomes.

Information from these pockets of locally well-sampled areas was supplemented by **data** from regional conventional and CSG exploration. Early models looked mostly at thermogenic processes. Subsequently, carbon isotope analysis of CSGs by Smith et al. (1992) suggested that some of the gases in the Sydney Basin and elsewhere on the eastern seaboard of Australia may be of biogenic origin. Gas in the southern Sydney Basin is dominated by thermogenic methane with minor biogenic accumulations along outcrop areas ( Figure 6; Faiz 1993). Local accumulations of CO 2 were also identified on anticlines and faults in the vicinity of igneous intrusions (Faiz 1993;Faiz & Hutton 1995;Faiz et al. 2003). CO 2 gas was principally interpreted as having migrated up dip from an igneous source and then trapped against impermeable layers on structural highs, a conventional gas migration and trapping mechanism (Faiz 1993), although the potential for carbonate dissolution and reprecipitation was also considered (Faiz et al. 2007b). More widespread occurrences of CO 2 were reported from the Hunter Coalfield (e.g. Pinetown et al. 2008;Thomson et al. 2008;Pinetown 2010Pinetown , 2014; Figure 6). Thomson et al. (2008) observed that CO 2 concentrations in the Lower Hunter Coalfield were located in a consistent and continuous layer between the biogenic and thermogenic methane layers identified by Faiz (1993). They proposed that this deep, high-gas-content CO 2 layer may have originated from regional Cenozoic volcanic activity and was transported into the subsurface by meteoric influx (as opposed to magmatic intrusions; Faiz 1993). It was also noted that the various gas layers in the subsurface cross-cut the regional dip of the strata."

Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that parkin binds to microtubule and tubulin proteins with high affinity and that parkin ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of ␣/␤-tubulin (34). It remains controversial whether putative in vitro substrates are relevant in vivo. Therefore, we investigated the ␣/␤-tubulin protein levels in park 1 mutants in vivo. Levels of ␣-tubulin were increased in park 1 mutant muscles (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the accumulation of ␣-tubulin in park 1 mutant muscles was dramatically reduced by DmGSTO1A expression, and it was enhanced in park 1 /DmGSTO1 null double mutant muscles (Fig. 3A). The levels of actin filaments in IFMs were unchanged in all mutants (Fig. 3B). These changes were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, C and D). We found that tubulin was slightly increased in DmGSTO1 null mutants by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). We also detected tubulin accumulation in DA neurons in park 1 mutants and park 1 / DmGSTO1 null double mutants (supplemental Fig. S3). These **data** indicate that parkin does not directly regulate the level of tubulin in Drosophila in vivo. In contrast to the change in total protein levels (Fig. 3C), there were no detectable changes in the ␣/␤-tubulin transcript levels in park 1 mutants regardless of DmGSTO1A expression level (Fig. 3E). Thus, the increased ␣/␤-tubulin levels were not caused by increased transcription but by protein accumulation. These results indicate that parkin is required for the regulation of tubulin levels and that DmG-STO1 suppresses the accumulation of tubulin in park 1 mutants."

So we concluded that CypA inhibits influenza virus replication at the translational level through impairing the viral protein synthesis or post-translation level by regulating the stability of the M1 protein. Our **data** suggested that CypA accelerated the degradation of M1 protein ( Figure 6). But we could not rule out the other possibility that CypA might inhibit the viral replication through impairing the viral proteins translation. Translational control of influenza virus is exerted at several steps in the viral life cycle. Thus, the virus has evolved strategies to take advantage of its requirement for cap-dependent translation initiation, as well as the recruitment of host cell proteins to aid in the translation of viral mRNA [28]. However, the host cell has also evolved to counteract the virus' mechanisms to bolster viral protein synthesis. For example, since viral translation is dependent upon functional eIF2a for translation initiation, viruses have developed strategies to prevent or reverse PKR-dependent eIF2a phosphorylation [29]. Influenza virus nonstructural (NS1) protein could interfere with dsRNA binding to PKR, thus preventing PKR dimerization and autophosphorylation [30]. So whether or not CypA regulates influenza viral protein translation need further study."

Speech **data** can be easily collected by telephone or by mobile front-ends face-to-face, and ki:e SB-C can be reliably calculated using the proprietary automatic speech analysis pipeline. Verification step of this study revealed that the automatic speech processing pipeline, including speech recognition, performs at an acceptable level across different languages and tasks, and therefore, automatic processing works reliably for the purposes of  the biomarker. The aim of the analytical validation was threefold: to evaluate (1) the ki:e SB-C against a cognitive gold standard measure (MMSE), (2) the biomarker's retest reliability, and (3) how well ki:e SB-C reflects agerelated -but clinically not relevant -changes. The results of the analytical validation analyses revealed that ki:e SB-C was a valid biomarker to measure cognitive abilities that are relevant for the target population, as seen by its high correlation with MMSE scores even if corrected for the effect of age. Furthermore, the automatically calculated biomarker was stable in retesting as assessed by a test-retest analysis. It is well established that aging is a risk factor for cognitive decline and diseases [26]; however, not all changes are pathological. It is important for a biomarker that is a surrogate for cognition to reflect subtle changes that are at a subclinical level. Our results showed that ki:e SB-C can detect age-related changes in cognitive function. These changes are also reflected in MMSE scores as a trend. Regarding the direct comparison with the MMSE on the healthy DeepSpA population, the SB-C seems to vary more marked by a larger standard deviation (regarding the mean) as compared to the MMSE. This might be also due to the fact that the SB-C is a more fine-grained measure as compared to the MMSE, which might especially in the healthy population lack the resolution to measure cognitive changes at this higher functioning level and would elicit less variance."

2238019,12/18,1.0,0.667,"Moreover, some peptides produced by translation of uORFs have been reported to interact with the ribosome, further diminishing the efficiency of protein translation (47,48). In contrast, regulation of yeast GCN4 translation by nutrient levels was independent of the peptide sequences encoded by its uORFs (49,50). Our current study showed that introduction of stop codon constructs (þS), thereby changing the sequence of peptide encoded by the uORF, exhibited changes similar to those seen in the translation of the downstream cistron ( Figure 5B). Furthermore, mutating the uAUGs while also introducing the stop codon (M þ S) caused a marked increase in the translation of the downstream cistron ( Figure 5D). These **data** show that regulation of the MOR uORF is independent of the peptide sequence of the uORF. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the uORF during MOR translation is a protein-independent mechanism. Although the mechanisms involved in explaining the inhibitory effects of the uORF peptide on translation are not understood, several models could be proposed. For example, the peptide of the uORF could be synthesized and have the ability to inhibit translation only at high concentrations in the local microenvironment (51)."

2111254,4/20,1.0,0.2,"Our **data** demonstrates phosphorylation network and transcriptional regulatory network utilize different network motifs. The motif ''regulator chain'' is only enriched in phosphorylation network. Based on the linear regulatory model ( Figure 1C), it can be inferred that KPFN is more predictive of co-function than KBN, which coincides with our observation. The ''bi-input'' motif is also enriched in phosphorylation network, resulting in a genetic buffering effect of phosphorylation events [4]. In transcriptional regulatory networks ''feed forward loop'' (FFL) motif was enriched, which have already been widely discussed [2] [15] [16]. The motifs with loop structure within regulators (bicomponent loop1, bi-component loop2) are also enriched in transcriptional regulatory networks. In these motifs, two TFs transcribe each other, and generate a bi-stable system, which switches between two alternative states [17] [2]. The two motifs tend to characterize an important mode in transcriptional regulation. TFs cooperate to regulate a set of genes (bi-component loop 2), but their functions are not completely redundant (bicomponent loop 1). For example, Ste12 and Tec1 are two TFs that co-regulate genes in filamentous pathway (for example, Kss1), but only Ste12 activates genes in mating pheromone pathway (for example, Ste3) ( Figure 2). In this case, the resultant signatures are divergent but their binding profiles overlap with each other on the co-regulated genes ( Figure S1). This phenomenon is termed mixed epistasis in phosphorylation network [4], where two kinase partly buffer each other, and also have unique functions themselves. We demonstrate that this definition can also be extended to transcriptional network according to the enriched bi-component loops. Because of the enriched buffering relationships in transcriptional regulatory networks, TFBN is more predictive of co-function than TFFN, which is also consistent with our observation. In the combined network, the enriched motif is FFL, which couples phosphorylation with transcription. A previous study showed that FFL formed by kinase CDK1 and transcriptional factors was important to drive temporal transcriptional responses in cell cycle regulation [11]."
1520137,10/35,2.0,0.286,"One may wonder whether the sensitivities in the 2AFC task could be derived as the derivatives of the psychometric function (the yes rate) observed in our yes-no task using the same stimuli [44]. The answer is not so. First, it is likely, as discussed earlier, that different mechanisms are involved in input discrimination (for assessing sensitivity) and object inference, such that the input sensitivities and yes rates may not be so simply related. The second reason for the negative answer is the following. The 2AFC tasks were typically performed in blocked sessions, each having only a single contextual condition, while our yes-no design randomly interleaves trials of the different contextual conditions, such that observers compensate fewer ''yes'' responses in one contextual condition by more ''yes'' responses in another within a single session. Hence, the yes rates in one context is influenced by the other contexts interleaved within the same experimental session. Consequently, the three yes rate curves in the same no context condition in our three experiments are different from each other, and none of them could be simply related to the sensitivites in the 2AFC task performed in blocked trials. Recently, Polat and Sagi [45] also found, by a yes-no design, different biases to respond ''yes'' for a gabor target in different colinear contexts (in terms of different target-context distances), when trials of different contextual conditions were interleaved. In comparison with their study, the current study additionally reveals how this bias depends on the contextual contrast, how a Bayesian model can explain the data, and our additional **data** and the model have enabled us to show that there is no colinear facilitation or suppression of target contrast in such a visual inference task."
218551852,5/20,2.0,0.25,"We observed a posterior to anterior gradient of convergence in the epiblast associated to a parallel gradient of ingression in the PS. A posterior to anterior gradient of cell motility of ingressed mesodermal cells has been documented along the regressing PS (Zamir et al., 2006). These graded movements in the mesoderm are largely controled by a posterior to anterior gradient of Fgf8 established in the PS and acting as a repellent on newly ingressed mesodermal cells at this stage (Yang et al., 2002). This cellular dynamics suggests that the movement away from the posterior PS could act as a sink for the epiblastic territories generating these progenitors. These cell movements in the epiblast and the ingressing mesoderm could explain the progressive exhaustion of the PS from its posterior end first described for the extraembryonic territory (Spratt Jr., 1947). Importantly, our **data** show that the precursor territories along the PS do not disappear at the same rate. We observe a sequential posterior to anterior exhaustion of the territories of the extraembryonic mesoderm, the lateral plate and the SOX2 negative paraxial mesoderm progenitors (Figure 3k). Combined to an increased proliferation in the NMP region, this would explain why the SOX2/T territory eventually remains as the major remnant of the PS in the tail bud after PS regression. Thus, the tail bud is composed of a mosaic of monopotent territories such as the precursors of the notochord, or the hindgut, and the multipotent NMPs, which give rise to descendants in the ectoderm and mesoderm. This likely explains why the tail bud appears as a site where gastrulation movements are still ongoing but also shows blastema characteristics (Catala et al., 1995;Davis and Kirschner, 2000;Gont et al., 1993;Holmdahl, 1925)."

245474094,6/22,1.0,0.273,"Most of the studies published to date refer to DHRS9 as a retinol dehydrogenase based on the previously published reports (16)(17)(18)36). However, as shown in the present study, DHRS9 is much more efficient toward oxylipins with hydroxyl groups at positions 12 and above than toward retinol or androsterone. It also appears that the members of the SDR9C  family have more divergent functions than the members of the SDR16C or SDR7C families, which primarily specialize in the oxidative (SDR16C) or reductive (SDR7C) metabolism of retinoids. Unlike human DHRS9, human RDH16 displayed much lower rates and higher K m values toward oxylipins than toward androsterone. This study utilized the same Sf9 microsomal preparations of SDRs that were previously analyzed for their activity toward all-trans-retinol and 3α-hydroxysteroids as substrates (34). To determine whether there was a loss of activity during storage, the microsomes were retested with saturating concentrations of all-trans-retinol and androsterone. These assays demonstrated that no significant loss of activity had occurred; thus, the catalytic efficiency of SDRs toward C18-C22 polyunsaturated hydroxylipids can be compared with the previously published **data** on all-trans-retinol and androsterone."

12555881,34/51,1.0,0.667,"Guar gum consumed at the dose used in the present study has been shown to improve cognitive performance, while maintaining blood glucose slightly above baseline. Like guar, kiwifruit alone was able to prevent blood glucose from dropping below the baseline and to significantly reduce hunger at 180 min ( Figure 6). This effect may be a consequence of differences in blood glucose combined with physical effects in the gut. Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, the results suggest that if kiwifruit contributes to maintenance of satiety, its effects on appetite are worth investigating further with the fully validated appetite scale in the context of obesity management. Similarly, assuming that satiety reflects physiological state, and given the results obtained with guar [18], the effects of kiwifruit on cognition should be explored in further research. Although the hunger results were possibly limited by experienced hunger not being a complete measure of appetite [19], it correlates with appetite. A possible limitation of the hunger **data** is that it is a subjective rating, and it was not possible to blind the subjects to the taste of kiwifruit or to the sensation of guar gum in the meals."
235565313,13/20,1.0,0.65,"However, the study presents some limitations. The structured interview used in **data** collection reduces the variation among responses due to its strict format [44].

In addition, only 21 out of the 31 LAGs from the North-West Development Region of Romania wanted to participate in the study. Although this is an acceptable proportion, the lack of response of some LAGs managers could be itself interpreted as a lack of interest in other additional activities than the ones established by the LDS. As in other previous research about LEADER [38,39], due to its limitation to a NUTS 2 development region, results cannot be generalized to the entire EU area. Nevertheless, the region is representative for Members States that joined EU after 2004 and especially for Romania.

52983639,6/12,1.0,0.5,"Ultimately, while many key insights were gained through the analysis of the reviews, the small number of reviews identified has limited our ability to form strong, specific, evidence-based recommendations. Nonetheless, several key insights have been drawn that can have a positive impact on the functioning and impact of SACs. We recommend that SACs include a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve members. Committees need to be large enough to encourage discussion and representation, but not too large as to lead to collective shirking. Communication was also noted to be a significant factor in SAC success. Thus we recommend that training and support be provided for committee members, as well as clearly delineated protocols and procedures for the group. In the same vein, the consequences of heterogeneity within SACs may pose a bar-rier to the group achieving their optimal performance. In order to overcome this barrier, we suggest implementing training measures and appointing experienced facilitators to fill gaps in knowledge and procedure, as suggested by the gathered evidence. However, conflicting **data** from the reviews prevents us from forming a concrete recommendation with regards to the optimal diversity within a SAC."
251711372,118/119,1.0,0.992,"While our study provides insightful implications, it is important to keep in mind its limitations. A key ingredient in an event study involves the date(s). Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination. We are aware that the magnitude of the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness announcements was influenced by the chosen dates."

233192205,6/21,3.0,0.286,"Previous reports have consistently shown that tau seeds can be transported into lysosomes after neuronal internalization (15,18,62) and some linked lysosomal dysfunction to Tau aggregation (26,63). Our lab has previously shown that internalized tau aggregates can result in the subsequent rupture of unidentified vesicles in neurons (14), enabling tau seeds to promote tau aggregation in the cytosol. Now, our present work identified the lysosomal delivery of Tau seeds as a key step in the process of seeded Tau aggregation. Based on our **data** we hypothesize that by reducing the transport of tau seeds into lysosomes via PIKfyve inhibition, tau seeding can be halted. In line with this idea it has been recently shown that exosomes containing Tau seeds require transport into the lysosome as well as lysosomal rupture to promote Tau aggregation (64). Whereas tau-seeds-induced rupture of lysosomes has not been shown yet, other protein oligomers such as α-synuclein fibrils are known to induce rupture of the lysosomal compartment and induce seeding (65)."
4456587,7/21,2.0,0.333,"Changes in gut microbiota may influence host metabolism in part due to the ability of the microbiota to attain colonic dietary conversion, resulting mostly in the production of fatty acid end products.

This may be due to the continuous increase in the area of forest land (especially broadleaf forest) due to the implementation of the reforestation project, which also brings an increase in the value of different ecosystem service functions [62,63]. However, it is noteworthy that between 2000 and 2018, there are 16 districts and counties with decreasing ESV per unit. The most significant decreases (more than 5000 USD/ha) were observed in Dadukou and Jiangbei.

15591492,10/34,1.0,0.294,"Together these **data** suggest a link between FGFR4, liver tumorigenesis, and liver cancer progression. Consequently, FGFR4 is a potential therapeutic target and its inhibition may provide a therapeutic benefit to liver cancer patients. To this end we developed an anti-FGFR4 neutralizing antibody (LD1). LD1 binds to FGFR4 and inhibits ligand binding, pathway activation, regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, and colony formation in vitro. The site at which LD1 binds to FGFR4 was localized by evaluating the interaction of LD1 with FGFR4 constructs bearing point mutations at sites that are similar between the FGFR4 orthologs but dissimilar in the FGFR1-3 orthologs; these amino acid residues in FGFR4 were substituted with the amino acid residues present at the equivalent positions in FGFR3. LD1 bound to wild type FGFR4 and most of the mutant FGFR4 constructs with the exception of the G165A mutant. The replacement of a glycine by an alanine at position 165 of FGFR4 nearly abolished LD1 binding. The exquisite specificity of LD1 for FGFR4 combined with the high identity of this region between FGFRs emphasizes the importance of this residue for LD1 binding. Glycine 165 in FGFR4 corresponds to alanine 171 in FGFR1. Interestingly, alanine 171 is the residue at the closest approach in the FGFR1 dimer interface [25]. Across the axis of the dimer, the side chain of alanine 171 of one receptor makes a hydrophobic contact with alanine 171 of the adjacent receptor. The sequence conservation in this region of the FGFRs is consistent with this region forming a receptorreceptor interface [25]. Thus, the binding of LD1 to this equivalent region of FGFR4 is likely disrupting receptor dimerization. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization is essential for the activation of FGFRs [26,27]. Therefore, inhibition of FGFR4 dimerization is a potential mechanism of action for LD1. A similar mechanism of action has already been described for other therapeutic antibodies [28]."

While the campaign increased hostility toward and distrust of the Ukrainian national government, it did little to mobilize public support of separatism. 52 Ultimately, Ukraine banned Russian broadcasts to the extent it could in the rest of the country, while national viewership of Russian news and other media drastically declined. 53 In the Donbas, support for the national government and the separatist cause was equally tepid. Russian-backed separatists had to resort to force because the information campaign failed to rally an indigenous uprising that could sweep Eastern Ukraine. 54 Far from being an integral element, the information campaign remained a sideshow throughout the conflict.

252600881,7/12,1.0,0.583,"Though statistically significant differences between the departments as well occupations could be attained, we recognize several limitations to our study. First the sample size of this study was unexpectedly small. This might be explained by specific idiosyncrasies of the German health system where both anesthetists and anaesthesiology nurses through their training co-specialize for intensive care. During the survey period workload in German ICU due to COVID-19 was especially high and relocation of personnel from operating theaters was not uncommon. Another explanation might be the mode of contact for inclusion in the study, since it relied on high motivation from the participating departments to forward the survey. Likewise, the total size of the respective departments is not known. A response rate could therefore not be calculated. This secondly results in the possibility that single departments might be highly overrepresented, resulting in misinterpretation of the effects of the implementation of eGENA on the SAQ. Thirdly this study did not compare the SAQ with the use of eGENA, but only its availability, and therefore only describes the effects of the occurrence of implementation. Since no **data** was obtained before the implementation the subgroups of the departments might have shown significant differences before the use of eGENA, so the effect of the implementation can't be assessed with this study. Yet the small sample size might have shown that small subgroups can be sufficient to generate statistically significant differences in the SAQ-GER. This Score therefore might even be of utility for benchmarking of smaller departments or hospitals, as well as ongoing surveillance."

It may be that utility theory comes more naturally to students, in terms of ease of understanding and use of language around the concepts -this is corroborated by the first author's prior extensive experience in teaching engineering ethics. Thus, it may be that since autonomy theory is more unfamiliar and harder to conceptualize, the increase in language specific to the theory is more easily detected with this assessment design. Alternatively, it could be that in teaching ethics through design, autonomy theory is indeed more effectively imparted to the students, and utility theory less so.

233192205,2/21,1.0,0.095,"Finally, we investigated the phosphoinositide kinase family, PIP5K (43). Within the PIP5K family, subfamilies can be distinguished, which include PIP5K (isoforms a,b,c) and PIP4K (isoforms a,b,c), which synthetize PI 4,5 P 2 (44), and PIKfyve, responsible for PI 3,5 P 2 formation (45). PI 4,5 P 2 modulates the initial steps of endocytosis through different mechanisms, including the modulation of actin polymerization by sequestering of actin binders (46); recruitment of proteins that mediate membrane curvature (e.g., BIN1) (47), and interaction with specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), glycancoated proteins that are reported to interact with K18 PFFs (17). On the other hand, PI 3,5 P 2 regulates endosomal vesicle maturation, in particular the maturing steps between the multivesicular body (MVB), late endosomes and lysosomes, including associated recycling events (48). We decided to target the different subfamilies of PIP5K using LV-shRNAs and test how these affect the process of K18 PFFs internalization using live-cell imaging. After imaging, samples were lysed and effective knockdown was confirmed through RT-qPCR. We tested the efficacy of three distinct LV-shRNAs in knocking down Pikfyve. LV-shRNA1 and 3 efficiently knocked EDITORS' PICK: PIKfyve mediates tau aggregates transport and its seeding down Pikfyve resulting in a concomitant significant decrease in K18-pHrodo signal in neurons. LV-shRNA2 was less effective in the knockdown of Pikfyve, giving rise to likewise less K18-pHrodo signal. (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, none of the control LV-shRNA used could affect Pikfyve mRNA expression of K18-pHrodo signal. These **data** suggest that PIKfyve function may be an important regulator in K18 PFFs internalization. Data on the effect of other PIP5K family knockdown can be consulted in Figure S5. Because the PIKfyve loss of function elicited the highest reduction in the K18-pHrodo signal, we decided to continue our study focusing on PIKfyve."

Among the ABA-related genes that have a higher transcript level in Ti-treated plants than in the controls, we can highlight NAP, one of the transcription factors involved in activating ABAbiosynthesis genes, components of the ABA sensor system like PYL4, PYL6, and PP2C52 and SNRK2s kinases that is upregulated in roots but not in shoots. However, ABAsynthesis genes do not seem to be affected by Ti treatment ( Figure 6A).

The resulting difficulty to record seizures with high density EEG pushed for ictal connectivity analysis based on clinical video-EEG. The largest cohort study so far was performed by Staljanssens et al. (55). One hundred and eleven seizures in 27 patients all with Engel class 1 outcome were localized using EEG source connectivity and ESI power. They showed that source space connectivity, compared to ESI power, significantly increases the performance from 42 to 94% to localize the SOZ within 10 mm from the resection. Despite the fact that several studies (26,(53)(54)(55)(56)(57) show the potential of ictal source localization using EEG source connectivity, there is only limited **data** available about their sensitivity and specificity in extra-temporal lobe epilepsy or in patients that did not become seizure free, which hampers the use of these methods in a clinical setting."

In addition, there is increasing evidence showing that these PRRs also sense endogenous danger signals, known as DAMPs that are released by necrotic cells. 107 The PRR group consists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and C-type lectin receptors. Depending on the cellular context, PRR triggering can induce different types of cell death. To date, TLR-mediated necrotic cell death has been described in cells triggered by TLR3, -4 and -9. Recognition of dsRNA or poly(I:C) (synthetic dsRNA analog) by TLR3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4 triggers the recruitment of an adaptor called Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-b, 108,109 which interacts with both RIPK1 and RIPK3 via its RHIM domain, 110 suggesting the possible involvement of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in TLR3-and TLR4-induced necrosis. Indeed, poly(I:C)-induced necroptotic cell death in the presence of interferon-b is inhibited in RIPK1-deficient cells 111 or when RIPK1 kinase activity is blocked. 24,34 Recently, it has been reported that poly(I:C) stimulation in a steatohepatitis disease model induces necrosis that is correlated with an increase in RIPK3 expression, indicating a possible role for RIPK3 in poly(I:C)induced regulated necrosis in vivo. 112 Triggering TLR4 by LPS prevents necrotic cell death of macrophages when either RIPK1 or RIPK3 is absent by RNA interference-mediated knockdown. 18,113 Together, these **data** suggest that TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation may induce RIPK1-and RIPK3dependent necroptosis (Figure 2b)."

251711372,78/119,1.0,0.655,"While our study provides insightful implications, it is important to keep in mind its limitations. A key ingredient in an event study involves the date(s). Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination. We are aware that the magnitude of the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness announcements was influenced by the chosen dates."

We predicted that the  virulence of ⌬rop54 II parasites would mimic that of the parental line if virulence were dependent on an IFN-␥-mediated immune response (but would still be dramatically lower if merely due to a reduction in growth in vivo). To test this, we i.p. injected 5,000 ROP54HA II or ⌬rop54 II parasites separately in IFN-␥R Ϫ/Ϫ mice and observed their morbidity. The IFN-␥R Ϫ/Ϫ mice demonstrated identical morbidity kinetics when infected with either ROP54HA II or ⌬rop54 II parasites (Fig. 6B). These **data** demonstrated that IFN-␥ signaling is necessary for the difference in virulence of ROP54HA II and ⌬rop54 II parasites and suggest that ROP54 enables parasites to evade an IFN-␥mediated immune response (14)."

First, the subject of this review could not be more current, since the use of interactive media is a global phenomenon that grows exponentially, especially in the current context of the Covid pandemic 19 63 . Second, this systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in strict accession to the COCHRANE recommendations and PRISMA guidelines.

Overall, our approach aimed to provide the most comprehensive **data** possible for the effects of interactive media on children and adolescent development, despite limitations in the included studies or our methodology. Firstly, our results indicated a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%) for the effect estimate of interactive media compared to no intervention on the language development outcome. It is likely that this heterogeneity result from clinical heterogeneity given the complexity of the interventions implemented in the included trials. To partially overcome this issue, we pooled **data** using the random-effects and the quality of evidence for this estimate was downgraded from high to moderate due to imprecision. Secondly, our systematic review included few trials and we were underpowered to investigate publication bias. As a rule of thumb, tests for funnel plot asymmetry should be used only when there are at least 10 studies included in the meta-analysis 47 . Thirdly, the participants consisted of a broad range of children with typical development of different ages and ethnicities.

In this sample, three participants (37.5% of sample) achieved the SDD (5 points) on the AHA following the 20 hours of combined intervention. Others have reported that 30% of participants achieved the SDD on the AHA following 90 hours of bimanual intervention alone [16]. Of the participants identified as a responder, two displayed contralateral circuitry and one displayed bilateral circuitry. In this subgroup of responders, we observed a wide range of baseline AHA scores (34 AHA units to 83 AHA units), age (8 to 14 years old), and both types of circuitry patterns. The single-case design of our study also allowed for individual analysis which may allow us to generate hypotheses for larger studies and may be preferred over group analyses that mask sensitivity of changes by evaluating group mean response. For example, participants 1 and 2 could be considered strong candidates for tDCS as they both displayed contralateral circuitry and high AHA scores at baseline. Both of these participants demonstrated further improvements following intervention on bimanual (AHA) and unimanual (Box and Blocks) measures. The improvements suggest that these participants had the ability to differentiate roles of the hands for bimanual tasks, and further improvements on the Box and Blocks may reflect a training benefit to each hand. In contrast, participant 8 displayed lower bimanual hand function at baseline and achieved the SDD on the AHA following intervention but did not demonstrate unimanual gains on the Box and Blocks. This suggests that this participant may have significantly benefitted from bimanual training alone. These preliminary **data** contribute to our understanding of who might benefit most from combined interventions or motor training alone which could be assessed in future studies that could guide personalized medicine approaches for stroke rehabilitation."
25826755,3/22,1.0,0.136,"We reported that DGC subunits are abundant in human airway smooth muscle tissue and cells (Sharma et al., 2008). Moreover, fluorescent microscopy has shown dystrophin and caveolin-1 exhibit overlapping immunolabeling in guinea pig taenia coli smooth muscle (North et al., 1993). To determine whether DGC subunits and caveolae share cellular domains we used sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation for subcellular fractionation of cells from human and canine airway smooth muscle tissue, and serum-deprived cultures of canine airway myocytes. DGC subunits (-dystroglycan, -, dand -sarcoglycan, and dystrophin) co-fractionate with high buoyant density caveolin-1-enriched microdomains (Fig. 1A,B). We next used double labeling of -dystroglycan and caveolin-1 to assess their colocalization in individual elongate contractile smooth muscle cells in culture ( Fig. 1C-E). The proteins were organized into markedly overlapping longitudinal arrays. However, in striking contrast, cells that lacked -dystroglycan (a feature of a short spindle shaped non-contractile myocyte subpopulation) did not form discrete linear arrays of caveolin-1 (Fig. 1E). To determine whether dystroglycan and caveolin-1 proteins interacted directly we performed immunoprecipitation, and found they could be readily co-precipitated from human and canine smooth muscle (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these **data** demonstrate that caveolin-1 interacts with -dystroglycan, and that this interaction might be crucial to orchestrate the ordered distribution of caveolae in contractile smooth muscle."

The goals of the present study were to determine the activation signal(s) for rprY and clarify its role in the oxidative stress response. We found that the regulator was essential for growth of P. gingivalis under sodiumlimited growth conditions. While the parent strain adapted and was able to grow, albeit slowly, under these conditions, an rprY mutant strain could not, indicating that RprY was essential for the response to this stress and hence viability. By transcription profiling and metabolite analyses we determined that sodium limitation induced an oxidative stress response in both parent and rprY mutants strains. However, the response was highly amplified in the mutant and was accompanied by dysregulation of genes encoding protein chaperones. We found that RprY interacted directly with the promoters of several chaperone genes, and collectively our **data** indicate that the regulator acts as a repressor of their expression.

This multidisciplinary approach to clinical trials in the study of status epilepticus [31,32] and stroke [33][34][35]  Further, efforts in harmonizing **data** collection in future trials of acute brain injuries, including curated multiple parametric and imaging **data** repositories, are urgently needed to facilitate subsequent **data** analyses and cohort discovery across populations."

Results demonstrate that having personally suffered worsened economic conditions during the global financial crisis of 2008 was associated with greater support for progressive taxation only for citizens whose economic prospects for the future had become pessimistic. Conversely, citizens who considered that the economic shock they had experienced in 2008 was temporary and were optimistic about the economic situation in the near future did not show support for progressive taxation. Overall, these findings show that only people who feel deprived and believe that things will get worse support redistribution, probably because they expect to benefit the most from redistributive policies."

The years 1997 to 2001 were the spinup period and excluded from the analysis (please see detailed description in ref. 75 ). In CLM, different types of vegetation within a grid cell are represented as separated tiles of different plant functional types (PFTs). We used subgrid PFTlevel model outputs to calculate sensible heat differences between different land cover types within the same model grid. The subgrid tiles within a model grid cell share the same atmospheric forcing, therefore replicating the assumption of similar meteorological conditions of the space-for-time approach 12 . To match the CLM5 model resolution, the dominant land cover types for forests and non-forest of each moving window were upscaled to 0.5°using the ESA land cover **data** ( Supplementary Fig. 9). Because CLM adopted a different land classification scheme, we created a look-up table to convert CLM land cover to the IGBP classification scheme (Supplementary Table 3). The differences in the sensible heat flux (ΔH) between a specific forest and a non-forest type can be extracted from the sensible heat values of the corresponding PFTs."

This would be in agreement with survey **data** on colony-stimulating activity in mouse and human sera, where serum activity has been found to be very low in germfree mice (11), to be high in mice from colonies with a high endemic rate of disease caused by pneumonia virus of mice, and to be elevated in humans in the acute stages of certain viral and protozoal infections. 1 The biological function of the colony-stimulating factor in the intact animal remains uncertain but its properties and occurrence suggest that it may be a normal humoral factor regulating leukopoiesis and that serum levels of the factor are elevated in acute infections when white cell changes are occurring as part of the host response to infection."

37841149,1/15,1.0,0.067,"To identify the binding partners of ROP54, we engineered an endogenous tagging construct that would add sequences encoding a 2ϫStrep 3ϫFlag epitope tag at the C-terminal end of the ROP54 gene (Fig. 3A). The tagged ROP54 properly localized to the rhoptry body, and therefore the strain was designated ROP54SF II (Fig. 3B). We additionally analyzed ROP54SF II by Western blotting, which revealed a doublet that was enriched for the slower-migrating band (Fig. 3C), suggesting that this is the primary product of ROP54. To determine if ROP54 interacted with the ROP5/17/18 complex or other members of the ROP kinase family, we purified ROP54 by using a Strep-Tactin column and eluted the ROP54 complex with desthiobiotin (10). Western blot analysis of the precolumn (pre) and elution (E) fractions with an anti-Flag antibody demonstrated a significant enrichment of ROP54 relative to the untagged control (Fig. 3D). The fractions were evaluated for known ROP kinases or pseudokinases (ROPs 5/18 as well ROPs 2/3/4 and ROP7), and none was enriched in our immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western blotting or mass spectrometry **data** ( Fig. 3E; see Table S2 in the supplemental material). These results suggest that ROP54 functions independently of the ROP5/17/18 complex and ROPs 2/4/7 on the PVM, although we cannot exclude more transient interactions that would have been disrupted during isolation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the ROP54 pulldown product did not identify any other known active kinases that may work in conjunction with ROP54. We did identify the small amounts of the inactive kinase ROP24 as well as another hypothetical protein with a predicted signal peptide (TGME49_237180), but tagging of these proteins suggested dense granule localization, and thus they were not pursued further (data not shown)."

Among the upregulated genes in roots, we found 23 genes coding for disease resistance proteins belonging to the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family, which are receptors involved in the detection mechanism of multiple pathogens (DeYoung and Innes, 2006). We also found the upregulation of CALMODULIN BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 2, 3, and 5 (CAMTAs) and WRKY70 (Supplementary Table S3), which act as suppressors of the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling routes respectively; both phytohormones closely related to pathogen defense responses (Li et al., 2004;Sun et al., 2019). Together, these **data** suggest that Ti sensitizes transcriptional responses involving a large number of genes related to pathogen defense, which expression may further be increased once the pathogen is perceived. Cell wall organization is another GO category (GO:0071555) that is enriched in the transcriptional response elicited by Ti in roots.

PTH was chosen because it is a potent regulator of bone metabolism exerting a direct effect on osteoblastic behavior (42). In osteoblastic cells such as ROS, PTH, via binding to its receptor, activates multiple second messenger systems, including the cAMP-protein kinase A cascade (43). Indeed, we found that PTH stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentrationdependent manner in ROS, as has been previously demonstrated (39,41). However, in antisense transfectants RCx4 and RCx16, cells exhibiting decreased Cx43 and, consequently, decreased coupling, PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation was dramatically attenuated. Additionally, we found that subconfluent ROS and bG, cells that display decreased coupling, similarly demonstrated decreased cAMP responses to PTH. However, the cAMP response to PTH was greater in subconfluent ROS and bG than in antisense transfectants, probably because coupling was greater in subconfluent ROS and bG relative to antisense transfectants. Taken together, these **data** indicate that a decrease in cell-to-cell coupling contributes to decreased hormonal responsiveness in ROS."

In other words, the expression level of downstream genes do not change upon deletion of the corresponding regulator. One explanation of this phenomenon is the buffering effect. For example, Mkk1 and Mkk2 are two redundant MAPKKs involved in the protein kinase signaling pathway that controls cell integrity. The deletion of either kinase has no significant effect, since the other one will take over its entire function. Another reason is that some kinase are inactive in normal conditions. This limitation can be compensated by measuring the expression level under conditions of induced stress or by constructing double mutation strains in which functionally redundant kinase are deleted simultaneously.

Hence, with evidence showing that the severity of extreme climatic patterns has increased since the 1990s, these events are under serious consideration and gaining attention. As part of a time series analysis, the recognition of a monotonic trend has prime importance. For applying statistical methods, a speculative composition requires the detection of trends. Due to the repercussions of climate variability, the non-homogeneity in the trends of hydrological series was shown. Statistical tests assist in identifying trends in stochastic or non-random arrangements.

The **data** was analyzed through various procedures, which involved performing tests to detect trends, occurrences, and stationarity of the **data** for the whole Punjab region, the results of which are shown in Table 4. The main concern during trend detection is finding out whether the values of a time series dataset have a familiar fluctuation with the increase of time; to this end, the ADF test aims to evaluate whether the average values or variances of a series change with the time. Almost all analysis techniques must suppose amorphous stationarity in the datasets whether the methods are linear or not.

However, in our experiments, continuous presence of antibiotics or only a pretreatment with antibiotics until the onset of the bioassays did make some although small differences. This was possibly because even when stopping the administration of antibiotics at the beginning of the bioassay, a carry-over effect may last for the tested five-day period, meaning that the reestablishment of an effective gut microbiota probably takes longer than the testing period. Antibiotics alone did not affect larval survival on non-Bt control maize varieties, which is in agreement with all other studies listed in Table 1."
1520137,28/35,2.0,0.8,"One may wonder whether the sensitivities in the 2AFC task could be derived as the derivatives of the psychometric function (the yes rate) observed in our yes-no task using the same stimuli [44]. The answer is not so. First, it is likely, as discussed earlier, that different mechanisms are involved in input discrimination (for assessing sensitivity) and object inference, such that the input sensitivities and yes rates may not be so simply related. The second reason for the negative answer is the following. The 2AFC tasks were typically performed in blocked sessions, each having only a single contextual condition, while our yes-no design randomly interleaves trials of the different contextual conditions, such that observers compensate fewer ''yes'' responses in one contextual condition by more ''yes'' responses in another within a single session. Hence, the yes rates in one context is influenced by the other contexts interleaved within the same experimental session. Consequently, the three yes rate curves in the same no context condition in our three experiments are different from each other, and none of them could be simply related to the sensitivites in the 2AFC task performed in blocked trials. Recently, Polat and Sagi [45] also found, by a yes-no design, different biases to respond ''yes'' for a gabor target in different colinear contexts (in terms of different target-context distances), when trials of different contextual conditions were interleaved. In comparison with their study, the current study additionally reveals how this bias depends on the contextual contrast, how a Bayesian model can explain the data, and our additional **data** and the model have enabled us to show that there is no colinear facilitation or suppression of target contrast in such a visual inference task."

Observers reported that they felt colder during the eclipse than before, but that does not necessarily imply that the air temperature dropped considerably, since much of the sensation may be due to an experienced reduction in direct radiative heating of the body. CEAZAMet operates a monitoring network with many stations inside the belt of totality of this eclipse which provided us with near-surface air temperature data. However, no 'obvious' pattern of change, such as a pronounced dip in the temperature curve, is consistently discernible at all or a majority of the stations. The eclipse occurred so close to sunset that temperatures had started dropping before C1 and little radiative energy was available after C4 to raise temperatures again. Furthermore, any features of the **data** from the day of the eclipse which could potentially be www.nature.com/scientificreports/ interpreted as dips in temperature do not stand out against the general background of intra-diurnal variability in the Coquimbo Region.

Earlier reports suggest that the increase and decrease of pentobarbitone-induced sleep time can be a useful tool for examining the stimulatory or inhibitory effects on CNS, especially for investigating influences on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA A ) ergic systems in CNS. [24] The previous report suggested that ethanolic extract of Jatamansi significantly altered locomotor activity. [25] Jatamansone exerted a tranquilizing effect in mice and monkeys [13] and a significant reduction in hyperactivity and improvement in restlessness and aggressiveness on hyperkinetic children similar to amphetamine. [8] Alcoholic extract of Jatamansi root increased the level of GABA on acute administration and increased the levels of most of the central biogenic amines and inhibitory neurotransmitters on chronic administration. [27] Thus, earlier studies indicate isolated compounds or extracts exert highly significant sedative activity while **data** of this study indicates    Benzodiazepines have been used for the treatment of insomnia and other CNS disorders predominantly. These drugs potentiate the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter of GABA, by binding to a specific site on the GABA A receptors to produce allosteric enhancement of anion flux through this ligand-gated chloride channel. [28,29] Most sedative-hypnotics used in the treatment of insomnia target the GABA A receptor. As test drug increased the duration of sleep time induced by a sub hypnotic dose of pentobarbitone, it can be stated that the drug may interact with pentobarbitone on the CNS via GABA A -ergic mechanisms in CNS."

Reuther (2007) report exposure ages of 15e17 ka from the Lake Starnberg region around (Ivy-Ochs et al., 2008), whereas Swiss perialpine lakes were ice-free at 20 ka ( Fig. 10H; Heiri et al., 2014). KW2015 **data** indicate the presence of a polar desert representing the coldest and driest conditions around 25e23 ka, in agreement to authors that suggest LGM glacier maxima during this period (Preusser et al., 2011;Monegato et al., 2017). Chronologically robust, KW2015 indicates comparable paleoenvironmental conditions around 29e30 ka, suggesting a correspondence to earlier Alpine glacier advances, consistent with the evidence from Baumkirchen (Sp€ otl et al., 2013), the Nesseltalgraben (Mayr et al., 2019), and the scheme from Heiri et al. (2014). Taking KW2015 reworked layers as reference, we may assume considerable Alpine glacier advances around 29e30 ka, followed by a retreat, another major advance peaking around 24e25 ka and a final moderate readvance around 20e21 ka. These fluctuations largely correspond to Ca 2þ maxima of the NGRIP dust record (Fischer et al., 2007) and indicate a coupling to hemispheric paleoclimatic evolution with considerable support of glaciations by Heinrich events 3 and 2 and ice volume reductions during GI 4, 3, and 2."
53743789,1/44,2.0,0.023,"In conclusion, the key issue of the controversy seems to be whether septicemia (by B. thuringiensis bacteria and/or commensal gut bacteria) or toxicemia (by the Cry toxins) are the prime killing agents alone or in conjunction. Experiments with GM plants expressing solely activated forms of Cry toxins and none of the other contested components, like B. thuringiensis bacteria, spores or crystals, will add complementary **data** still missing in this contentious debate. Although Mason et al. [21] administered Cry toxins from a commercial formulation of GM Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria, no studies were carried out to date with Cry toxins produced in GM plants. With GM Bt crops, the role of any B. thuringiensis cells or spores, or those of other GM Bt-expressing microbes (e.g., P. fluorescens, E. coli) is a non-issue, the mode of action of GM plant produced Cry toxins hinges solely on their biochemical characteristics. Any effect of added antibiotics would to a large extent, if not exclusively, be limited to interfering with the commensal gut bacteria in the test species. Using GM plants expressing Cry toxin is also interesting since the biochemical form of Cry toxins produced by GM plants differs significantly from those produced in GM bacteria [7]."

134734280,4/12,1.0,0.333,"The message from this study is clear. p-XRF's role in characterising coarse wares such as Impasto and Cooking wares begins after their fabrics have been defined, either macroscopically or petrographically, p-XRF's considerable attributes then come into play providing in the field rapid analyses of the cut (sawn) surface of large numbers of sherds; this can be viewed as a 'screening' procedure generating chemical **data** which is scrutinised in the light of the fabric classification to make useful, if broadly based statements about identity, for instance precisely those elucidated in this studyvolcanic vs. non-volcanic or local vs. non-local. The chemical classification should not be expected to be amenable to a more detailed level of interpretation, paralleling the outcome of the other p-XRF  investigation at San Vincenzo on soils from different excavated contexts (Di Renzoni, et al., 2016). For sure, there is room for the analytical protocol to be refined beyond that described in the present study in order to improve accuracy, to allow additional elements to be included in the **data** set and to calibrate with respect to the corresponding **data** obtained by destructive analysis such as benchtop WDXRF (Jones & Campbell, in press). We suggest that p-XRF should not be habitually compared to ICP/NAA and repeatedly be found wanting in its inability to cover all elements and /or display equivalent levels of accuracy for all elements. At the same time p-XRF should not develop a 'scatter gun' reputation, generating one-off **data** which cannot be reused or can only be used for internalin-house -purposes. It is time to look boldly at its greatest attribute, that is, that of non-destructive, in situ, analysis aimed at analysing large quantities of sherds; equally important is our ability to formulate appropriate questions that it can answer, satisfactorily and conclusively. In the case of impasto ware there is already a good understanding of the origin and production of these wares; so the need now is to process large quantities of newly excavated material, and to assess whether they are imported or not. This study has shown that this type of assessment (local vs non local) is indeed feasible and effective. Coarse wares are amongst the most common fabrics found in many archaeological sites so the implication of the results of this study goes beyond the remit of our work on Stromboli.

246493125,1/5,1.0,0.2,"Forests exhibit regionally varying effects on JJA cloud cover based on MODIS **data** (overpass at 13:30 local time, Fig. 1a). Most temperate and boreal forests in Eurasia and North America have higher cloud fractions than non-forest, indicating a cloud enhancement effect (positive ΔCloud) accounting for 63.21% of all grid samples with a global mean magnitude of +0.0133. In contrast, forests in South Amazon, Central Africa, and Southeast US have lower cloud fractions than nearby non-forest, signifying a cloud inhibition effect (negative ΔCloud) over the forest with a global mean magnitude of −0.0115. The strength of these contrasting cloud effects (i.e., cloud enhancement and inhibition) follows a latitudinal dependency with the largest magnitude in the tropical regions and diminished toward higher latitudes (Fig. 1b). This is likely due to preferential conditions for convection development at low latitudes, as indicated by their high convective available potential energy, which decreases at higher latitudes 27 . Our additional sensitivity tests indicate that the global pattern of ΔCloud holds when estimated using alternative window sizes ( Supplementary Fig. 2) and split time periods (2002-2007, 2008-2013, 2014-2018, Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting the robustness of results to scale of a local window and interannual variability of cloud cover."

Importantly, although participants were objectively in the same income range, subjective socio-economic status was successfully varied by providing them a fictitious feedback about their relative standing in the social and economic ladder. This manipulation allows us to conclude that potentially confounding variables, which typically covary with individuals' actual socio-economic status (e.g., political orientation, tax attitudes, system justification) can not account for our findings."

Therefore, we decided to explore in more detail the effect of Ti treatment on the transcript level of genes involved in SA biosynthesis and signaling routes. Our **data** showed that several SA-related molecular components were responsive to Ti treatment in both shoot and roots. We found that several NBS-LRR receptors are upregulated in Ti-treated roots but only a few in shoots ( Figure 8A). PAD4, which is part of the SA regulatory module is upregulated in roots and lightly in shoots. The positive regulators of SA biosynthesis WRKY54, WRKY70, and CBP60g, are upregulated in roots, and WRKY54 only in shoots. The negative regulators of SA biosynthesis CAMTA2, CAMTA3, and CAMTA5 are also upregulated in roots with only CAMTA3 faintly upregulated in shoots. Interestingly no SA biosynthesis genes were found upregulated either in roots or shoots, suggesting that Ti might preactivate positive regulators of SA biosynthesis but at the same time negative regulators to prevent an undesirable high level of SA that could affect plant growth. NPR1 and NPR3, which regulate the SA response pathway are upregulated in roots but only NPR3 is upregulated in shoots. Downstream of SA perception by NPR1, pathogen-related genes, and WRKYs transcription factors are activated directly by TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6, which ultimately activate the global plant immune response known as SAR. TGA2 and TGA6 are upregulated in shoots while PR1 and WES1 are upregulated in the shoot. The cell death positive regulator SBB1 is upregulated in both roots and shoots whereas the mRNA exporter DRH1 which is needed to initiate cell death, is not. We also found the receptors BAK1 and BKK1, negative regulators of SAdependent cell death, are down-regulated in roots but not in shoots ( Figure 8B).

1242367,12/15,1.0,0.8,"Our findings may help to consider preventive interventions across other samples displaying EF impairments, such as children with autism or those from low socioeconomic backgrounds (see Kishiyama et al. 2009). Relevant interventions may include computerized EF training and organizational skills training. Indeed, interventions that specifically target improving EFs in preschool children have shown promising results (Diamond et al. 2007). This intervention is particularly interesting given its integration into classroom settings. Other computerized interventions focusing on specific aspects of EF (namely, working memory) have also been shown to be effective in reducing symptom severity and improving working memory in children with ADHD (Klingberg et al. 2002;Klingberg et al. 2005); one study showed increases in prefrontal and parietal activity during working memory tasks after treatment (Olesen et al. 2003). Although this working memory training paradigm is indeed promising, it will be important for researchers other than the developer to replicate such results. Also, our results provide initial support for screening children for EF deficits to initiate preventive measures, although far more work on psychometrics and predictive validity is needed before such an endeavor can become a reality.

Both A. thaliana and tomato RNAi protein sequences were then used to screen the transcriptome assembly of N. benthamiana using tBLASTn. The most significant matches to A. thaliana and tomato queries were manually assessed and in cases of multiple matches, the query coverage (%) and identity (%) of high-scoring segment pairs were analysed further. Where possible, a full length sequence was manually reconstituted from the shorter transcript sequences, and where this was not possible, sequence **data** from our draft genome assembly [7] and/or from the N. benthamiana sequences deposited in the Solgenomics database [12] was used.

1520137,20/35,1.0,0.571,"We study how visual perception of a target bar can be biased by contextual bars in the image, and how a Bayesian model of object inference can account for the data. Human observers are more likely to perceive a target bar when the contextual contrast, i.e., the luminance difference between the contextual bars and background, is weaker rather than stronger. Relative to the situation without the context, they are biased to perceive the target in a context of weak contrast when the target can perceptually group well with the context, as if the context fills in the target. Meanwhile, they are biased not to perceive the target in a context of strong contrast, as if the context suppresses the perception, regardless of whether it could perceptually group well with the would-be target. The Bayesian model illustrates that the context influences the perception by biasing (1) observers' prior belief that a target should be present and (2) observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts from a target bar.

201251303,1/10,1.0,0.1,"Spatial dependence is the measure of the degree to which one object correlated to other nearby objects. It plays an essential role in a wide range of empirical economic studies (Yu, 2017), such as regional and urban economics, environmental and public health (Jerret et al., 2010), social networks (Wong et al., 2006) and agricultural (Holloway et al., 2002). Ignoring the spatial dependence in the **data** may lead to inefficient, and or biased and inconsistent estimation (Anselin and Florax, 2013). Spatial regression is the formation of a regression model using location data. In spatial regression, observations at a site depend on observations located in other adjacent locations, so that there are spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. In the presence of spatial autocorrelation in a model, a least square method cannot be employed to estimate the model parameters due to biased and inconsistent estimators. In many applications, we have to model dependent variables that reflect binary outcomes generated by spatially dependent processes. Spatial dependence in binary outcomes result in a situation were observed at one location are similar to others at nearby locations. Holloway, Shankara, and Rahman (2002) show that binary outcomes regarding the adoption of an agricultural program by Bangladeshi rice producers exhibited spatial dependence. One of probit variant models which focused on spatial autoregressive is Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) probit model. As well as spatial autocorrelation and if **data** varies spatially, it is reasonable to think that variances may vary also. Models typically imply heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, but some specifications include autocorrelation without heteroscedasticity. Heteroscedasticity can be a potential problem in a spatial model with discrete dependent variables and makes the standard probit estimator inconsistent."

A Baysian model for the parameter estimation of auto-regressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) processes [9] are discussed in [6,19,16]. These models are based on time domain data. However, the de-correlation property of wavelet transforms facilitates a simplified model construction, and multiple wavelet-based Bayesian techniques has been developed.

134689280,7/20,1.0,0.35,"While conjecturing is not as strong a process as fully fledged reconstruction, there is a risk of getting caught in the fallacy of perfection. In archaeological reconstruction, there is the tendency of reconstructing everything to an absolutely pristine and clean state. Buildings and surfaces are all fully functional and, in outstanding condition, their environments devoid of any form of pollution. One could argue this striving for perfection is a kind of hyperrealism. The reconstructed situation is not one that likely ever existed. A true reconstruction of the past should account for areas laying fallow and buildings in disuse or disrepair. Such occurrences would have been part and parcel of a built environment in flux. Beyond the visual impression, the critical social interpretive importance of perfection generated by conjecture or reconstruction can vary. This depends on the purpose of analysis or interpretation, i.e. what is the newly constructed **data** supposed to comment on or contribute to? To illustrate this, let me err on the spatial side of the analytical spectrum. The reliability of population estimates based on buildings heavily depends on knowledge or assumptions that determine which were occupied and which had only occasional, shared, intermittent, or partial use (introducing degrees of spatial duplication or redundancy). However, a general understanding of the functional structure or spatial experience and opportunities for inhabitants does not rely on information about which house was occupied at each specific moment in time or its state of repair. From our own experience, we can accept that when a house is unoccupied, would we always know? And when it is dilapidated, it is still recognisable as a house and still poses a physical impediment to access that space. The building still has potential to be a household or to be repurposed. The space and the experience of that space is still structured in roughly the same way, even if the affective and sociocultural context may differ from particular case to particular case. The point is to alert us to the fact that when the notion of occupiable space (to understand how boundaries compose built environments) requires us to conjecture, we create an approximation of a situation in the past, not a reconstruction of any particular situation in the past. A sufficiently critical research design will be aware of both the social interpretive limitations and opportunities this offers."
