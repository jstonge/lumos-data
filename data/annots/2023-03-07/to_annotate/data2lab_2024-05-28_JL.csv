State aid to airlines raises doubts about the appropriateness of the pre-COVID-19 **data** used in cross-sectional regressions in Panel 2 of Table 2 for vaccine announcement analysis. For example, due to state aid and bailouts, the ownership structure and indebtedness of airlines had already changed when vaccines were announced to be effective. According to the IATA, the global airline debt had increased by $220 billion by the end of 2020, where state aid accounted for between 1% (Latin America) and 25% (North America) of airline operating revenues in2019. 7 We evaluate Equation (4) for the seven variables, using the most recent **data** for many of the control variables to draw any relevant explanatory power from them. The control variables are calculated based on interim accounting figures for the year 2020.

196643668,7/34,1.0,0.206,"SNP calling is a statistical likelihood procedure (Nielsen et al., 2011) for each nucleotide position in the genome. As a result, the number of false positives will scale with the overall genome size. Moreover, chemically mutagenized lines have a low true positive rate (1/125,000 to 1/500,000 bp) resulting in a relatively higher proportion of false positives. This is in stark contrast to the use of SNP calling for distinguishing natural populations, in which multiple orders of magnitude more true positives are present. We initially attempted to score each SNP as a molecular marker in our sequencing **data** and found that many adjacent neighboring SNPs were not linked in the three fully sequenced individuals that shared the ""10"" pedigree. This violates the predicted inheritance of these chromosomes and DNA segments (data not shown). We hypothesized that a high ratio of false positives in the SNP calling procedure was interfering with mapping and cosegregation. To detect positions in the genome that were false positive SNP calls, we identified genomic positions that were scored as variant in more than one independently mutagenized line. We compared SNP calls from the line 10 derivatives (10-2, 10-3, and 10-d), the aphenotypic EMS-treated line 12 (12-2) and the previously published dhr2-1 mutant (Krothapalli et al, 2013). SNPs shared between independent lineages are highly unlikely to be due to independently mutagenized chromosomes. Far more likely, any SNP variation shared between the 10, 12, and dhr2-1 pedigrees would be caused by systematic bias in the generation and analysis of sequencing data. These shared SNPs should detect 1.) errors in the reference sequence, 2.) differences between the mutagenized material and the originally sequenced line, and 3.) positions in the genome that frequently return a likely SNP call due to structure or paralogy. Furthermore, only those SNPs present in the 10 lines and not in 12-2 or dhr2-1 can be causative for the extreme dwarf locus segregating in that lineage. Figure  Only a minority of differences was found when comparing the three lineages of line 10, which indicates the majority of these shared SNPs are not the result of base calling errors in the reference sequence. Table 3 provides the filtered common SNP variations for individual samples considering either genome-wide SNP **data** or only SNPs in coding sequences."

The technique used in this study is the single seed NIR spectra acquisition as described in [43], where a single bean is placed in the scanner of CvSU In GaAs-based NIR instrument. The instrument was allowed to warm-up for a period of at least 30 minutes so that the light output and electronics related to spectrometer would stabilize prior to spectra collection. After warming up the instrument, the spectral precision for the two groups of sample was determined. This was done by scanning ten different samples (re-loaded group) of civet coffee and the tenth sample scanned for another ten times (non-reloaded group)."

235565313,1/20,1.0,0.05,"In Romania, the LEADER approach continues in its second implementation period. The first LAGs were selected in 2011, less than a decade ago. In the 2014-2020 programming period, 239 Local Action Groups were funded, with a total budget of EUR 563 million [36]. The weak administrative capacity, the strong local negative political influences, and the high level of mistrust between actors inherited from the socialist era mostly explained the low LEADER success [31]. It has been noted that the policy instruments were inadequately implemented to local realities [37]. In addition, the quality of the LAG's Development Strategies was strongly influenced by the socio-economic **data** availability, proving to have low direct impacts especially in supporting the shift toward a low-carbon and climateresilient economy, and knowledge transfer and innovation [26]. Responding to the existing academic literature gaps on the LEADER approach, this paper aims to: (1) underline the most important tangible direct (non-LEADER) and indirect multiplier effects of the LAGs in Romania; (2) identify the enabling LAGs characteristics that can better maximize such multiplier effects in future rural development public policies; and (3) establish the conditions for maximizing the multiplication effects in future LEADER actions based on the awareness level of the LAGs managers. Thus, three hypotheses were formulated: H1 better multiplication results are obtained when the private and NGO partners are better engaged in the decision-making process of the Local Development Strategy; H2 LAGs with a larger and more experienced team are able to generate more consistent multiplication effects, by creating new projects supported from other non-LEADER funding; H3 more-experienced LAGs, with a greater capacity to involve partners, are generating better multiplier effects. The results can offer important insights and lessons regarding the implementation of Community-Led Local Development in countries with a weak participatory culture. LAGs should not act as one-off project but as an integral part in the sustainable development of European rural areas [5]. Therefore, the results should also indicate LAGs real level of sustainability. Are they able to continue their activity and to generate development in rural areas without LEADER funding?"

The correlation between the individuals' median suppression durations and the fMRI responses might not be due to the stable characteristics of the individuals; instead, it might be due solely to the duration of the suppression periods itself, regardless of the individual differences. If this is true then, for example, when the fMRI responses were derived from equally long suppression periods, the fMRI responses of subjects with long suppression periods would be as strong as those of subjects with short suppression periods. To explore the neural correlates of the individual differences in perceptual dynamics during BR, controlling for the effect of the duration of the suppression itself, we performed a partial correlation analysis. Specifically, for each subject, the suppression periods within the range from 6 to 34 s were divided into seven bins of 4-s wide. Within this range, **data** from most of the subjects were available (mostly from 11 subjects; **data** from at least 7 subjects).

These in vitro translation results were similar to those observed with LUC activities in NMB cells transfected with similar constructs. To understand how the translation of the first initiation codon can affect subsequent initiation events, we characterized the relative efficiency of all the initiation codons. Figure 2C shows the relative strength of each initiation context represented in arbitrary units relative to the LUC ATG context (i.e., a Strong Kozak sequence, designated 1.00), which has one of the closest matches to the strong context.

Hydrographical parameters were thus estimated from an average weighted inversely to the distance (or dissimilarity) of the five best analogues selected. The significant novelty, here intro-duced, is that the set of parameters reconstructed on the basis of PF was considerably enlarged thanks to an update of the modern hydrographical references. Usually, published reconstructions based on PF assemblages are limited to sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). This limitation is the result of long lasting questionings on the significance of the derived reconstructions with regard to the ecology of PF. It is difficult to disentangle ecological parameters in the marine realm [25] and SSTs often carry the most significant weight in the distribution of species [12]. However, following what has been obtained with other fossil protist groups, we decided to go beyond this limitation in order to expand the potential of the PF tool."

Furthermore, a calibration procedure is used to identify model parameters that vary non-linearly across individuals' anthropometrics.

2903113,3/11,1.0,0.273,"The AR is unusual among steroid hormone receptors in that the major transactivation function is activation function-1 (AF1) situated within the N-terminal domain rather than AF2 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is relatively weak in the AR (6,31,33). Furthermore, AF1 can be subdivided into two discrete, overlapping activation domains, the usage of which is context-dependent. Although almost the entire N terminus (residues 1-494) is required for full activity of the full-length receptor, a core that contributes 50% of the activity is located between residues 101 and 360, and this region has been termed TAU1. However, in the absence of the LBD, a different region mediates activation, and this region is termed TAU5 (residues 370 -494) (31) (Fig. 2A). We performed pulldown interaction assays to determine the interaction of full-length HEYL with full-length and deletion constructs of AR. These showed that GST-HEYL was able to interact strongly with full-length AR expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a robust interaction was also observed between full-length HEYL and GST-NTD, which contains the AR N-terminal domain (residues 1-556) but lacks the LBD and most of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), indicating that HEYL likely interacts with AR via the N-terminal transactivation domain (Fig. 2B). In support of this, no interaction was seen between HEYL and GST fused to the LBD in the presence or absence of ligand. To determine whether HEYL also represses AR-AF1 activity, we transfected COS-1 cells with an AR deletion construct lacking amino acids 654 -919 (AR⌬LBD), which is constitutively active. HEYL could significantly repress the activity of AR⌬LBD on TAT-GRE-E1B-LUC (Fig. 2C) and Probasin-LUC promoter constructs (data not shown). Together, these **data** indicate that HEYL interacts with and represses AR activity largely through AF1. To narrow down the functional domain affected, we next assayed the ability of HEYL to repress AR deletion constructs lacking either TAU1 (AR⌬1) or TAU5 (AR⌬5) (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S3). This showed that deletion of either domain resulted in reduced relative repression of AR activity by HEYL; however, the repression of AR⌬1 (with intact TAU5) by HEYL was proportionately less than that of AR⌬5 (with intact TAU1), indicating that TAU1 (residues 101-360) is likely to be the functional domain that is primarily affected by HEYL in the context of the full-length AR."

(2009), also reported that P. manihoti was a new invasive species attacking cassava in Indonesia. Sartiami et al. (2014) reported that the mealybugs were also found in Malaysia. Yonow et al. (2017) indicated that P. manihoti have been spreading to Indonesia. The polyphagia of papaya mealybug was the first record in Indonesia in 2008 (Muniappan at al., 2008). Papaya mealybugs attacked 32 plant genera including papaya and cassava which was in severe category (Susilo et al., 2009). The attacks of Phenacoccus manihoti and Paracoccus marginatus in cassava are usually undistinguishable, so farmers assume that the two mealybugs are the same species."

This suggests that a number of smallholder farmers in Ghana, especially in the Ketu North District, are more sceptical about new technologies and may want to see pictures or videos of people using them before making adoption decisions or probably wait for about half of the population adopting them before they also decide to use them. Also, by comparison, the percentages obtained for each adopter category in the present study vary from the percentages of Roger adopter categories (see Figure 1). In the present study, we observed a trend of downwards reduction in innovativeness to an upwards increase in less innovativeness. For instance, innovators are 1.4% in the current study as against 2.5% in Rogers and Laggards are 17.9% presently as against 16% in Rogers. Therefore, the obtained result suggests that a result from a macro level study (used by Rogers) may not show the same result at the micro-level (present study). i.e., Rogers' work was developed for the market (macro-scale), whereas the current study was developed for a category of farmers (micro-scale). Table 5 presents the logistic regression analysis results that test the four hypotheses on the effect of the predictor variables on the response variable.

Many experimental and computational approaches endeavor to disclose the pair-wise interactions of both networks [1] [2] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]. However, integrative studies of the two networks are very limited. A recent study generated a first-generation phosphorylation map for S.cerevisiae, and integrated the phosphorylation results with transcription factor binding **data** [1]. The results demonstrated that the largest class of kinase substrate is transcription factors, and revealed several new regulatory modules. Another study demonstrated in the cell cycle process, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and transcription factors commonly form feed forward loops to activate different phases of the cell cycle [11]. In these studies, kinase/phosphatase and transcription factor are connected via biochemical interactions. Although such approaches have shed light on the prevalent regulatory motifs in the signaling network, the functional link between these regulators cannot be inferred. In this study, we propose to link kinase/phosphatase and transcription factor by using the transcriptome as an anchor."

Our decision to use survey **data** was shaped by the demonstrated advantages of this research method including efficiency, generalizability, and versatility (Fowler, 2014). While several waves of the Ghana national census **data** are available, the items covered therein do not allow for an in-depth examination of the day-to-day experiences in the lives of Ghanaian women, especially in the area of empowerment. This is largely because demographic **data** typically tends to focus simply on the outcomes of processes that may have relevance for the empowerment of women, rather than on the empowerment dynamic of such processes or interpersonal interactions. For instance, while national surveys do provide information about number of children living in a household, they do not examine related sexuality issues such as the extent to which sex is viewed as a source of pleasure vs. simply as a procreational process (Pereira, 2003). Feminist scholars such as McFadden (2003) have (i) argued that sexuality needs to be conceptually distinguished from reproduction, (ii) demonstrated the relationship between power and sexual pleasure, and (iii) implied that the importance ascribed to female sexual pleasure, even in the context of legallysanctioned long-term, heterosexual, committed relationships, is an index of feminist choice. Furthermore, the national census does not explore the adherence with traditional values such as those captured by proverbs. As such, detailed information about the state of affairs in the lives of contemporary Ghanaian women is best gleaned from surveys designed to explore decision-making and empowerment, such as the Ghana Everyday Lives Survey."

Additionally, proverbs are historically imprecise cultural artifacts since it is impossible to situate them in an exact period in history.

The samples originated from the main geological areas around Turó de la Font de la Canya and provide a first overview of the strontium isotopic ranges from the vicinity of the site to 130 Km away to the West. The sampling of the Pleistocene sediments of the Vallès-Penedès valley proved challenging due to the high degree of human impact in this area, which prevented us to collect reliable samples. The strontium results from the large majority of the archaeological samples (27 out of   neighbouring Garraf mountains indicates that livestock was present in this coastal mountain area during the first millennium BC [62][63][64][65]. Interestingly, the strontium results obtained so far at Turó de la Font de la Canya suggest that this human community did not pasture its sheep and goats on the Garraf or other neighbouring mountains on a regular basis. Only six teeth out of the 34 analysed have a strontium signature compatible with that of the Cretaceous limestones of the Garraf, despite their proximity (circa 4 km as the crow flies). Overall, the limited variability of strontium ratios points towards local rearing of caprines rather than longdistance trade of animals. The homogeneity of the strontium results contrast with the diversity of imports recovered from the site, which include Cruz del Negro pottery from the Straits of Gibraltar, Tanit figurines of Punic origin, a clay mask from the central or eastern Mediterranean, and numerous Campanian A ceramics from Italy in the levels dated from the 4 th and 3 rd centuries BC among others [20][21][22]. While the possibility cannot be excluded that the sheep and goats analysed originated from other areas with similar geology, the homogeneity of tooth values in a fairly large sample argues against this. It seems, therefore, that sheep and goats were mainly bred locally, and only 'prestige' goods (e.g. Phoenician wine, Greek pottery) arrived from distant sources."

8738507,6/20,1.0,0.3,"To date, all reports that have attempted to detect a genetic association of individual HML-2 proviruses have had a predominant focus to K113 and K115, given their status as the most recently integrated and conserved HML-2 loci known, however their analysis (over several diverse populations and disease groups) have offered little support for any implications in disease. This is perhaps not surprising, as a provirus that did have negative effects to the host would have a much reduced probability of population fixation, or would likely be removed from the population by selection. Thus, those proviruses with rare frequencies among humans would be more appropriate candidates for inference of disease-associated loci. The detection of such elements will necessitate much larger sample sizes than have been used to date, including the analysis presented here. Repeated searches for a disease association with one or two particular elements alone, such as has been the case for the K113 and K115 proviruses, will likely have similar outcomes as have been observed. We attempted to overcome such limitations by screening human genomes from the CPS-II ACS Nutritional Cohort using a highly specific DNA hybridization in a case-control comparison; we interpret our **data** to indicate the detectable presence of several as-yet-uncharacterized polymorphic proviruses, though none infer genetic association to disease."

8738507,6/20,2.0,0.3,"We note that, although ""new"" bands observed from the unblots have a high likelihood of representing HML-2 containing genomic fragments, they may not reflect previously undescribed proviruses. For example, they could possibly have been a consequence of single base changes in known proviruses that destroyed or created a target sequence for BsrI restriction enzyme cleavage, Furthermore, the absence of certain bands in some samples could result from known full-length proviruses that have recombined to form solo LTRs in some individuals, or from recombination-mediated structural variation with reference to the human Hg19 build that would be undetectable in our approach. Also, a point mutation could lead to the generation of a new restriction site, for example within the 5' LTR, that would prevent the detection of the corresponding junction fragment by the probe. We searched for such an example from the fragments that we could tentatively identify as described HML-2 (asterisks in Figure 2A), and found the PCR and unblot **data** were in agreement, giving support that the BsrI target sites for these particular elements have not been disrupted. However, without knowledge of the chromosomal site of integration for each detected fragment, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of mutation (or possibly common SNPs among subjects) having occurred at restriction sites proximal to other detected proviruses."

Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA modeling, which not only features a quasiexperimental design, but also takes into consideration of the autoregressive moving-average process of the data, would produce statistically more rigorous findings. Based on the results of the augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, as well as examinations of both an auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF), ARIMA models for different types of policing activities were identified and analyzed.

The IID model assumes uncorrelated locations and velocities (equivalent to kernel density estimation), whereas the OU and OUF models describe a tendency of directed movement towards a central location (e.g. the center of a home range). OU and OUF models both describe a restricted space use process (e.g. residency in a home range) but are distinguished in that velocities are uncorrelated with OU, whereas velocity is correlated with OUF (Calabrese et al. 2016). Both the OU and OUF models estimate home range size and the position autocorrelation time, typically interpreted as home range crossing time. We averaged the probability density functions from the utilization distributions of each of the individual radiocollared wolves in a pack to obtain the home range for each pack (C.

The cluster analysis of spectra from an untreated (control) leaf are shown in Figure 3. The spectra from each cluster can be saved to perform multivariate **data** analysis with all spectra. Each cluster is displayed in a different color based on the similarities of protein, lipid, lignin, and polysaccharide spectral regions. The gray color represents spectra from mesophyll, while the spectra of the vascular bundle appear in two clusters indicated by light green (cluster 2) and light blue (cluster 3) colors. The clusters coded with pink (cluster 5) and blue (cluster 4) were related spatially to epidermis tissue. The average spectrum from each cluster is shown in Figure 3(b) and 3(c). These results indicate stronger ester carbonyl absorbance in the epidermis spectra (1729 cm −1 ), and weaker in the vascular bundle spectra. We assumed that higher levels of endogenous lipids in the epidermis and higher levels of lignin in vascular bundle tissue accounted for these spectral similarities and differences. The highest level of protein (1621 cm −1 ) was seen in the spectra coded with gray and assigned to mesophyll). The amide I band maximum centered at 1621 cm −1 indicating that these cells contain proteins with pronounced β-sheet secondary structure. By contrast, spectra related to epidermis tissue have an amide I band profile presenting both α-helix (1648 cm −1 ) and β-sheet structure (1618 cm −1 ) with less intense absorbance of β-sheet and more intense absorbance from α-helix protein secondary structure compared to mesophyll tissue spectra."

In addition, vignettes can be written in a way that overcomes the multicollinearity and nonorthogonality among variables as they occur in the real world, while still appearing just as realistic to participants (Ludwick et al., 2004;Taylor, 2006;Wallander, 2009).

Eleven social vulnerability indicators were identified using Bogardi, Birkman and Cardona conceptual framework. The result found that an SoVI estimated for O.R. Tambo district was very high with a Likert scale of 5 for cultural values and practices, security or safety, social networks, social dependence, preparedness strategies and psychological stress attributed for the high value of social vulnerability to drought. Indigenous knowledge and education had an SoVI value of 2, which was of low vulnerability, contributing positively to resilience to drought. The study also found that government involvement in drought risk reduction is limited; as a result, the study recommends that a national, provincial and district municipalities policy on drought risk reduction and mitigation should be developed. White and Howe (2002) argued that there is a realisation that effective natural hazard prevention and mitigation will need to address not only the hydrological-meteorological factors but also the economic and social factors which influence the greater society and reinforce the impact of hazardous events. Wilhite (2005) stated that social vulnerability to drought is increasing at an alarming rate in many parts of the world and South Africa and O.R. Tambo district is not an exception."

The age at which patient had first sexual exposure ranged between 13 and 17 years. This age group represents the most vulnerable population for acquiring STIs. Women at this age are biologically more susceptible to acquire STI and the difference can be attributed to the epithelial lining of the cervix, as columnar epithelium in young women is more susceptible to infection and probability of developing neoplasia becomes more when exposed to human papillomavirus (HPV). [9] The core group theory postulates that there is a central or 'core' group of individual who are infected with an STI and who can transmit the infection at a particular high rate thus maintaining the infection in a community by transmitting the infection to many partners. [10] Sex workers together with their clients form one such group. In our study group there were 39 CSW amongst whom 18 had multiple STIs.

Rare inherited disorders have long provided a unique window on the genetic basis of disease. Individuals inherit two copies of a gene; one from each parent. In a recessive disorder, if one copy is defective (a mutant allele), the alternate copy is usually suffi cient to maintain normal function of the encoded protein. If an individual inherits two defective copies, protein function is disrupted, leading to disease. Often, two different mutant alleles of the same gene are present in one person, a phenomenon called compound heterozygosity. Whether these still cause disease depends on the gene in question."

217125084,36/57,1.0,0.632,"To explore the reason of these duplication events, we searched for the genomic regions containing the MAPKK genes which are possible synteny. Most duplicate gene pairs occurred in syntenic genomic regions, suggesting that these multiple gene copies were caused by whole genome or segmental duplications ( Fig. 4; Additional files 11 and 12). Particularly, the duplication events of group A MKK1, MKK2 and MKK6 took place in the common ancestor of core eudicots corresponding with the γ WGD ( Fig. 4; [40]). The two duplications of group A MKKs in Brassicaceae were involved in the α/β WGDs within the Brassicaceae lineage (Additional file 11; [40]). With the studies on the WGD events for many species were previously carried out, we collected these **data** and their paleopolyploidy histories (Fig. 3). We then assessed the duplication events to the influence of the size in group A MAPKKs. The comparison implied that the WGDs might be conducive to the expansion of the orthology groups from some species. In order to further confirm the roles of genome duplication to the gene family expansion, we carried out the co-relationship analysis between rounds of genome duplication about MAPKK genes. The correlation coefficient was calculated as 0.549 (P < 0.01) for the group A MAPKKs. The results suggested that the WGD significantly contributed to the gene expansion for group A MKKs."
251843619,39/73,1.0,0.534,"The assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementation is critical to identifying implementation strategies. 13 14 While barriers and facilitators have typically been assessed at the individual level, there is growing recognition that for large-scale organisational change efforts, it is critical to understand factors that influence the collective behaviour change that results in systems redesign. 15 This is particularly relevant to QI initiatives, which involve multiple interdisciplinary team members, such as physicians, nurses, administrative staff and **data** managers. Understanding aspects of readiness allows one to determine an organisation's capacity and willingness to implement evidence-based interventions, such as PC-QIs, into practice. 16 Moreover, an exploration of the implementation context is also important for identifying barriers and facilitators to change. 17 As part of a programme of research developing and implementing PC-QIs for system-level use in Canada, our study aimed to assess readiness of organisations to implement PC-QIs and explore barriers and facilitators to implementation from the perspective of Canadian provincial/regional/territorial QI leads (representing a 'system-level' perspective) and healthcare providers (clinical perspective).

In time series data, observations have a natural temporal ordering. Observations close in time may have stronger correlations than observations further apart. Because of this non-independence or autocorrelation, t-tests may not be able to detect the intervention effect adequately. Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA modeling, which not only features a quasiexperimental design, but also takes into consideration of the autoregressive moving-average process of the data, would produce statistically more rigorous findings. Based on the results of the augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, as well as examinations of both an auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF), ARIMA models for different types of policing activities were identified and analyzed. A binary variable (before-after-March 12, 2020) was set up to examine the interrupted effects of the COVID-19. In the case of examining the patrol and DRT self-initiated activities, to control for the step change between the emergence of COVID-19 and the death of George Floyd, the indicator of the George Floyd incident was also included in the models. Fig. 1 presents the time sequence trend graphs for each reactivity and proactivity measure. With respect to reactivity, violent crime calls appeared to increase slightly after COVID-19. For calls for property crime, there appeared to be a reduction coinciding with COVID-19, but then a return to pre-COVID levels. Disorder calls varied greatly pre-COVID, with observable increases and decreases, but appeared to increase after COVID-19.

Compared with the developed eastern regions (hereinafter referred to as E-region), the central and western regions (hereinafter referred to as CW-regions) are considered to be the ""catch-up"" economy. At present, there is a large gap of the GDP and green GDP between the central and western regions and the eastern region in China. In 1995, the per capita GDP of the eastern, central, and western regions (1995 as the base year) grew on average by 8409.64, 3701.55, and 3197.10 RMB Yuan, respectively. By 2017, they reached 58,091.94, 30,825.91, and 26,345.55 RMB Yuan, respectively. The absolute gap has been widening. However, the mean growth rates of per capita GDP in the three regions were 9.36%, 10.16%, and 9.99%, respectively. The per capita GDP growth rates of the CW-regions were 0.8% and 0.63% faster than that of the E-region, that is, the CWregions have achieved relatively faster development. It is generally believed that green technology is more difficult to develop [6], so green development in the CW-regions may be difficult. However, we calculated the green GDP of the three regions (see Section 2 for specific methods) and found that although the absolute gap between the green GDP of the CW-regions and the E-region is relatively large, the mean growth rate of the per capita green GDP in the CW-regions is significantly higher than the E-region. In 1995, the per capita green GDP of the three regions (1995 as the base year) were 8147.39, 3,492.00, and 2968.95 RMB Yuan, respectively, and by 2017 they were 56,545.22, 29,475.74, and 24,628.81 RMB Yuan, respectively. The per capita green GDP in the three regions grew on average by 9.37%, 10.22%, and 10.04%, respectively. The per capita GDP growth rates in the CW-regions were 0.85% and 0.67% faster than those in the E-region, which shows that the per capita green GDP of the CW-regions is catching up with the E-region at a significantly faster rate than the per capita GDP. Previous research has focused more on exploring the backwardness advantage of the traditional economy while ignoring the backwardness advantage of green GDP. However, the above **data** shows that the CW-regions are more likely to have a backwardness advantage of green development."

238581401,1/34,1.0,0.029,"Disulfiram (Antabuse), a drug used for almost 70 years to treat alcohol abuse, is an emerging candidate for repurposing in cancer therapy. Antitumor activity of disulfiram (DSF) is supported by numerous preclinical studies, case reports, and small clinical trials [1][2][3], yet clinical **data** from larger randomized trials are still lacking. Despite several promising case reports about durable remissions of advanced-stage cancer patients after DSF therapy [1,4,5], results from clinical trials are still limited and less favorable [6], a trend that is shared with other repurposed drugs [7]. The results from the few clinical trials available so far suggest that DSF´s anticancer effect may be limited to a subset of cancer patients [8,9], thereby raising a need for the identification of biomarkers that would help guide the patient selection in the future. A broader assessment of DSF in clinical oncology had been hindered mainly by the unknown identity of the active anticancer metabolite and its mechanism of action in cancer cells, including the key molecular target. Consequently, there is currently no reliable way to predict who among cancer patients is likely to benefit from the DSF treatment. In an effort to improve this situation, we have recently discovered that DSF is metabolized in the human body to bis-diethyldithiocarbamatecopper complex (CuET), that CuET represents the long-sought-after active compound that kills cancer cells, and that mechanistically, such toxicity to cancer cells reflects CuET-mediated impairment of NPL4, an essential cofactor of p97 segregase broadly involved in the degradation of cellular proteins [10,11]. We have also noticed that the CuET complex levels assessed after administration of the same dose of DSF vary significantly among patients [10]. We hypothesize that the observed variable clinical responses to DSF treatment might be attributable, at least in part, to the divergent extent of CuET formation, a process that is likely influenced by genetic and environmental factors, the latter including copper intake and the overall diet. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DSF treatment may be affected also by factors such as concomitant exposure to other drugs or pharmaceutically active compounds, a scenario particularly likely for advancedstage cancer patients. With the primary mechanism of anticancer activity of DSF known, the identification of such factors that impact cellular responses to DSF/ CuET is key to facilitate the repurposing of DSF in clinical oncology."
54551628,9/17,1.0,0.529,"Because of the proposed role of date hubs as vital linkages between modules, deletion of date hubs should cause a collapse of the entire network. This result was indeed seen in smaller **data** sets, and gave support to the initial concept of date hubs. In the larger set, however, no such collapse occurs, as many alternative links still exist between modules even after the deletion of putative date hubs. Neither does the date-versus-party distinction emerge from analysis of co-expression: some hub proteins are co-expressed with their interacting partners more than others, but there is a continuous range from massive co-expression to very little co-expression, not two distinct classes of co-expression behavior. Finally, it has been predicted that date hubs evolve more quickly than party hubs, because their intermodular function allows them more fl exibility than a party hub, whose function (it has been argued) is more rigidly fi xed by its role within its module. When the authors tested this prediction for yeast protein evolution, no such correlation emerged. Together, these **data** indicate that the date-party distinction is more likely a property of the small **data** set it was developed from than a bona fi de attribute of the global yeast protein interaction network."
58646123,8/26,3.0,0.308,"Two further methodological considerations are appropriate here. First, we noted that population density and night time lighting may be considered bad controls as these may be intricately linked with soil nutrients. We therefore investigated the stability of the estimates by omitting these potentially ""bad"" controls from (1). The results are provided in the appendix (S1 Table) but are largely similar to those reported in Table 7. The key difference being that micronutrients no longer explain child mortality. Second, our dataset is considerably large (around and over 300,000 observations) which is driven by the richness of the underlying soil dataset. Tables 6 and 7 reflect an analysis in which we disaggregated, or rather transposed, the observed health outcomes of a specific district to the unobserved outcomes in each location within that district. To our knowledge there is no objection on econometric grounds to the approach followed, except for the fact that measurement errors in child health outcomes in a district now carry over to all observations in that district, making the followed clustering approach across subnational regions or countries imperative. That said, increasing the number of observations in this way may somewhat artificially raise the odds of finding significant effects. Therefore, as a robustness check, we estimated (1) for all health outcomes with all variables aggregated (averaged) to the district level at which health outcomes were measured. The results are presented in the appendix (S2 Table), showing that most of the key findings remain (with respect to significance levels and size of coefficients) in such a more parsimonious **data** set."

Conversely, the results from strontium isotopic analysis on sheep and goats suggest that animal were reared locally, and so probably on a small-scale basis, and that caprines slaughtered at the site were mainly reared in the Penedès valley and perhaps also the neighbouring Vallès. This local breeding of livestock may reflect (and be a consequence of) the local socio-political context. The significant change in settlement pattern in the Late Bronze and Iron Ages-from open-air sites located on the plains to fortified settlements located on hills-is thought to reflect increased warfare and territoriality [1,5,7,66], while weapons in some tombs and severed heads at several sites suggest the existence of a military elite at this time [18][19]. Perhaps, even if long-distance maritime trade flourished during the Iron Age across the Mediterranean, long-distance terrestrial movements of livestock were difficult in the north-east Iberian Peninsula at this time."

During PS regression, i.e. up to the 10-12-somite stage, the SOX2/T cells were maintained in the epiblast lateral to the anterior-most part of the PS, below the Hensen's node (Arrowhead, Figure 1g). After the 10-somite stage, cells were found in continuity with the posterior-most SOX2 positive/T negative neural tube ( Figure 1g). These SOX2/T cells eventually became located in a superficial region of the tail bud at the 25-somite stage where they remain at least until stage 26HH (Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012) ( Figure 1g). In order to analyze the lineage continuity of cells of the anterior PS region, we performed local electroporation of small groups of epiblast cells with a H2B-GFP reporter in ovo, targeting the SOX2/T-positive territory of the anterior PS region at stage 5HH ( Figure 1h). We next performed confocal live imaging of the electroporated embryos to track the electroporated cells and their progeny at the 25-somite stage (Supplementary movie 1). At this stage, electroporated cells were found in the neural tube, the paraxial mesoderm and the superficial region of the tail bud where the SOX2/T cells were identified (Figure 1g, i, Supplementary Figure 4a-b). Thus, this tail bud territory contains descendants of the SOX2/T cells of the anterior PS epiblast region of stage 5HH embryos. We next performed time-lapse imaging to track fluorescent cells from this superficial SOX2/T positive territory to examine their fate (Figure 1i .

196643668,1/34,2.0,0.029,"In this work, we compared the results of whole genome, short-read sequencing of a sorghum dwarf mutant to similar **data** from independently-derived EMS-mutagenized lines. By collecting whole genome sequence **data** from two phenotypically unaffected individuals in an EMS population and using the **data** from a previously published unrelated mutant in dhurrinase2 (Krothapalli et al., 2013), we were able to identify nucleotide positions in the sorghum genome that resulted in SNP calls in more than one lineage. These positions cannot be the causative mutation for any phenotypes unique to one lineage. Initial SNP calls were not consistent with the result of guanine residue alkylation, the mechanism of EMS mutagenesis. After removal of the shared alleles identified between the three mutants and considering only the coding sequence SNPs, the proportion of G:C to A:T changes, the expected changes from EMS treatment, ranged from 79 to 91 percent per line. We measured allele frequencies of these SNPs in sequence **data** from wild type, heterozygous and, dwarf siblings. The vast majority of these SNPs displayed allele frequencies incongruent with the mutant allele status of the line. Allele frequencies for one region on chromosome 10 segregated with the mutant phenotype, identifying this region as encoding the dwarf mutant. One, and only one, coding sequence change was present in the delimited interval in the dwarf, missing from the wild-type sibling, and heterozygous in the heterozygote sibling's genome. This polymorphism introduces a premature stop codon in the ent-kaurene oxidase gene of sorghum (Sobic.010G172700), encoding a putative enzyme in gibberellin biosynthesis. The mutation co-segregated with the dwarf phenotype, which was reversed by GA application, and confirmed the causative nature of this polymorphism. Using EMSinduced SNP variation as molecular markers permits any phenotypically unaffected line to act as an EMS Variation Induced Lines (EVIL twins) for mapping crosses without introducing the segregation variation of a distinct and diverse genetic background. The use of pre-existing **data** to remove error prone positions to improve SNP calling and EVIL twins for mapping should improve both the accuracy and sensitivity of forward genetics."
197564349,11/23,1.0,0.478,"One of the governing mechanisms for the colloidal behaviour of clays is isomorphous substitution, i.e. the exchange of cations of similar size and valence whilst the crystal structure is preserved. This process is completed during the formation of minerals and is the factor that determines the permanent charge of the mineral and thus its cation exchange capacity. Combined with the pore water chemistry, this permanent charge of the clay mineral governs the behaviour of the colloid system. Isomorphous substitution is significant in expandable minerals. Smectite minerals have high cation exchange capacities (CEC), in the range of 80-150 meq/100g [24] and are vulnerable to charge changes. Therefore, the emerging scale length in the SAXS **data** could be attributed to replacement of cations, especially from the interlayer exchangeable cations due to the new charge equilibrium of the global clay stacked structure. Large pore water gradients, and hence flow rates, present in the monotonic loading stages would not allow a stable ionic composition around the particles, required for an equilibrium state. On the other hand, illite, which is a low cation exchange capacity mineral, does not show similar behaviour. Nonetheless, average increase in spacing of values around 1 Å is relatively small, close to the bond length of covalent bonds."

15300788,8/12,1.0,0.667,"When measuring high-quality diffraction **data** for HPMX experiments, care should be provided in selecting the optimum wavelength. The chosen energy will have a direct influence on the resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, X-ray absorption by cell components, and will be dependent on the detector characteristics, often optimized for a specific set of energies. Ultra-short wavelengths of the order of 0.25-0.05 Å have been reported as being optimal for HPMX studies (Fourme et al., 2001). At AR-NW12A, the shortest wavelength available is 0.70 Å , limited by the cut-off ($ 3.5 mrad) of the focusing mirror reflectivity downstream of the monochromator, rather than by the X-ray undulator source (see Fig. 1 of Chavas et al., 2013). A typical diffraction pattern recorded during HPMX experiments is shown Fig. 3. Although sub-optimal, **data** collection at 0.70 Å should increase the crystal lifetime approximately by a factor of two, when compared with **data** collection at 1.00 Å , in accordance with  calculations of the dose-dependent decay of crystals exposed to wavelengths of 0.70 Å and 1.00 Å , respectively, with a conserved incoming flux of 1.0 Â 10 11 photons s À1 mm À2 in an area of 200 mm Â 200 mm (calculations performed using Raddose version 2.0; Paithankar et al., 2009). Moreover, the ADSC Quantum 210r CCD X-ray detector implemented at AR-NW12A is calibrated to have its detective quantum efficiency (DQE) maximized at the wavelength of 1 Å . Although no major troubles could be observed in the **data** recorded so far with an energy beam of 17.7 keV (0.70 Å ), HPMX at AR-NW12A could improve in **data** quality if a detector calibrated for higher energies was available. The recommended beam size at AR-NW12A varies from 100 mm Â 100 mm to 200 mm Â 200 mm, in positive cases where access to sufficiently large crystals is possible. A clear advantage of this large beam size lies in the fact that a larger volume of the crystal is exposed to the X-ray beam, resulting in increased signal at higher energies. A comparison of **data** collected at PF AR-NW12A with **data** recorded at SPring-8 BL41XU (Kawamoto et al., 2001), where a sharper beam was available, clearly suggested that a larger beam size coupled with a lower flux was beneficial for collecting fully usable **data** at room temperature (unpublished results)."
7301550,7/12,2.0,0.583,"There is a strong relationship in our **data** between BMI and breast size-each additional BMI unit corresponds to an increase of about 0.1 cup sizes on average. However, the SNPs in Table 1 are not in LD with any variants previously associated with BMI [35]; this is expected due to the inclusion of bra band size (which is correlated with BMI) as a covariate. Furthermore, even if we did not control for BMI, the strongest associations with BMI (e.g., rs1558902 near FTO) have effects of about 0.4 BMI units per allele. This would correspond to an expected β of about 0.04 for breast size for these SNPs, which is below the effect sizes we are powered to detect here. Indeed, if bra band size is not included as a covariate, rs1558902 has an estimated β of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04 -0.10) for breast size and p-value of 8·10 −6 as compared to β of 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01 -0.07) with bra band size included."

External concepts about life cycle **data** and learning about zero emission technologies feature prominently in the researchers' and municipality's accounts, whereas the kindergarten representative's story is driven by local concerns for safety, speedy implementation, and installations that improve the kindergarten's immediate purpose: to be a good place for children and employees alike.

A corresponding lacuna exists in the pilot project storyline. For the researchers and municipal supporters of the pilot project, the building's occupants remain mostly outside the story: as passive recipients given a 'fantastic opportunity'. The distance between the requirements of the external concepts and locally anchored understandings of the kindergarten was too great, and they never came close to meeting in the middle. Representatives from the kindergartens had no desire to be experimented upon and no need for untested solutions. The stories told highlight the importance of local knowledge and information exchange by the municipality because although routines for institutional representation were in place, the kindergarten's felt that their voices were not heard.

Following a significant correlation or t-test, we used linear or (in the case of PA variables) binary logistic regression with EF measures as predictors and academic, social, and global impairment measures as criterion variables, first controlling for IQ and then controlling for group status (ADHD vs. comparison), both of which were assessed at baseline. On the basis of these initial regressions, we reasoned that because IQ deficits are inherent to ADHD, controlling for both IQ and group concurrently would constitute overcontrol (see Miller and Chapman 2001). Thus, we emphasize findings with the more stringent covariate of group status (ADHD vs. comparison). Finally, following a significant regression analysis, we added the interaction term of the EF predictor x group status as the last step in the equation, to test for moderation by ADHD status."

This can be explained by limitations in the measurement process. UV meter sensor can only cover a certain irradiance angle. Therefore, when measuring the UV intensity of two lamps symmetrically positioned on wall, it will not be able to cover the entire incident light, leading to a slight decrease in fluence rate. In one UV lamp setup, the UV meter sensor cover the irradiance angle better than in two UV lamp setup, making a better accuracy rate.  "

280802,1/21,1.0,0.048,"The response of WNV infection in the brain is characterized with massive inflammatory events including production of cytokines such as IL-1β, -6 and TNF-α, and chemokines [4,11,21,22]. Studies aimed at understanding the role of innate immune response in WNV-infected brain have so far largely focused on chemokines. The role of the chemokines such as MCP-5 (or CCL12), IP-10 (or CXCL10), MIG (or CXCL9) have been established in recruitment of virus-specific T-cells and virus clearance [21,23]. However the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α in neuropathogenesis following WNV infection remains obscure. Few studies have recently characterized the role of TNF-α in WNV infection in a mouse model, but the **data** remain controversial [24][25][26]. Although microglia and astrocytes are classically believed to serve as the predominant source of these cytokines in the CNS, neurons can highly express these cytokines in the setting of disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), spinal cord injury, stroke, and sciatic nerve injury [27][28][29]. Since neurons are the prime target for WNV replication, it seems likely that they may act as a central processor of inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory molecules. These proinflammatory molecules may further activate downstream apoptotic signaling pathway(s) in neurons ultimately resulting in neuronal death and/or activate glial cells, which can further exacerbate neuroinflammation. Herein, we directly evaluate the ability of WNV-infected neurons to produce key proinflammatory cytokines and their role in mediating neuroinflammatory markers and neuronal death."

In time series data, observations have a natural temporal ordering. Observations close in time may have stronger correlations than observations further apart. Because of this non-independence or autocorrelation, t-tests may not be able to detect the intervention effect adequately. Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA modeling, which not only features a quasiexperimental design, but also takes into consideration of the autoregressive moving-average process of the data, would produce statistically more rigorous findings. Based on the results of the augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, as well as examinations of both an auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF), ARIMA models for different types of policing activities were identified and analyzed. A binary variable (before-after-March 12, 2020) was set up to examine the interrupted effects of the COVID-19.

58646123,9/26,1.0,0.346,"We first establish the costs of increasing the densities of soil nutrients. This calculation is relatively straightforward by considering the definition of the factors as explained in Section 3.2. Specifically, a unit increase of factor 1 (capturing the variation in zinc, copper and manganese) implies that the underlying normalized soil nutrient variables each increase by one as well. Or, by virtue of the normalization (see section 3.2), each of the soil nutrient variables increases by one standard deviation. We make some simplifying assumptions. First, we ignore the other, smaller factor loadings, thus only calculating the costs for a standard deviation increase in zinc, copper and manganese. Second, we value these elements by considering recent price **data** from the London Metal Exchange. We thereby ignore all possible transaction costs involved in getting these elements included in inorganic fertilizers and transported to and applied at farmers' fields. Moreover, not all fertilizer-applied nutrients may directly be available for plant nutrition. In other words, the cost estimate is a lower bound of the actual costs involved. Table 9 shows the calculation of the costs involved (i.e. the lower bound as per the discussion above) of raising the soil nutrient densities in one grid cell (of 5km x 5km) by one standard deviation. Taken together these costs amount to a little less than USD 80,000 per grid cell using price **data** from the London Metal Exchange [47]."

In this experiment, normal LB medium (LB0+ NaCl) contains separately added 171 mM NaCl. As shown in Fig. 1A, omission of NaCl (LB0) caused a three-to six-fold increase in expression of the LacZ fusion, although there was an approximate three-fold decrease in growth of the strain (not shown). However, the increase in LacZ expression still occurred when sorbitol at equivalent osmolarity (500 mM) was substituted for NaCl (i.e., LB0+ sorbitol) which did not compromise growth (not shown), indicating that growth rate did not affect expression of the lacZ fusion. On the other hand, substitution with KCl (LB0+KCl) conferred lower expression similar to that in normal medium. (Not shown is that as much as 400 mM additional NaCl to normal medium had no effect). The E.coli rprY-lacZ fusion strain was grown in complete and NaCl-depleted LB and in complete LB containing lithium chloride (LiCl). As a substrate analogue of Na, Li uses many of the same permeases for uptake, therefore when Li + is present in excess bacterial cells use it instead of Na + , leading to disruption of the normal sodium cycle [21]. RprY-lacZ fusion expression was assayed at different times during growth in three media: normal LB with and without Na + , and normal LB with LiCl (500 mM). Expression of rprY-lacZ was elevated for up to 150 mins in Na + -depleted broth before declining (Fig. 1B). The **data** indicated that the rprY promoter responded immediately to Na + depletion and also suggested that after cells adapted to the condition rprY expression is no longer required. Addition of LiCl resulted in growth retardation of the strain (data not shown), however the expression of the rprY-lacZ fusion increased up to 90 mins after addition of LiCl suggesting that the uptake of Li + caused Na + depletion (Fig. 1B). In summary, these experiments indicated that depletion of Na + activated expression of the rprY  promoter in E. coli and expression of rprY was affected by monovalent cation concentration and not osmotic stress."

Yet, interactions with the calcium and magnesium factor point to the exact opposite.

Reinforcing bars from concrete waste can be recycled for remelting. The treatment process of steel often involves charging, melting and decarburization [26]. Similarly, wood waste accounts for a small amount of construction waste, and is collected by scrap dealers and can be incinerated as fuel after on-site sorting [17]. Regarding the mortar waste, separation from the recycling process of concrete is not conducted. However, the value of cement mortar is relatively low when compared with other waste compositions [15]. This is because mortar waste is built with high porosity and water absorption rates that can weaken the strength and mechanical performance of recycled aggregates made by concrete waste [27,28]. Thus, we assume that the treatment process of recycling mortar waste is the same as that of concrete, and the value of recycled mortar is ignored."

58646123,4/26,1.0,0.154,"We set to explain variation in four health indicators (Table 1) commonly used to assess the impact of malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, in 2010, childhood underweight was responsible for around 19% of under-five deaths and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss, zinc deficiencies for around 5% of under-five deaths and DALY loss and iron deficiencies for around 0.6% of child deaths and 6% of total DALY loss [3]. Indicators used in this analysis are those from the Demographic and Health survey [19]. Highly detailed maps revealing spatial variation in incidences of stunting and wasting (at 5km x 5km) across Africa have been published recently [30]. The estimation procedure used to generate these maps relies on covariates that are similar to the ones underlying the estimates of soil nutrient maps used in this study (see section 3.2). For this reason, these maps, and the underlying data, are unsuitable for use in our assessment for risk of identifying a spurious relationship. These indicators are provided at subnational level for all African countries.

Only well-annotated, autosomal probes with validated chromosomal location and gene function based on the most recent annotation in NCBI and UCSC as of October 2011 were included for the association tests. In the process we aligned all probes to the reference genome (hg19), excluded ambiguous and all non-RefSeq probes, and removed 427 probes overlaying known SNPs from the analysis.

235565313,5/20,2.0,0.25,"Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify similar LAGs into homogenous groups. This method allows one to empirically identify the most important characteristics in maximizing the multiplier effects. Therefore, the LAGs from a certain cluster should be as similar as possible to each other but as distinct as possible from the LAGs belonging to other clusters [51]. The method minimizes variability within clusters and maximizes variability between them [49]. The Squared Euclidean Distance and Ward's method were used to generate similar sized clusters, with a similar degree of tightness. The hierarchical clustering does not require a priori decision regarding the final number of clusters [52]. However, the results are strongly influenced by outliers; therefore, they were firstly identified and removed (LAG 16) from the **data** set using the Single Linkage method [51]. Cluster analysis was previously used by other authors in studies related to LAGs impact [25,49,50,53]. A possible limitation of the method could be the small number of the cases. Although the literature does not impose any constraints related to the minimum number of elements that are required to successfully apply the method, it is generally accepted that having more cases provides stronger results [51]. The analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 20.0).  "

The reference estimate of how a meteorological variable would have behaved on the same day but in absence of the eclipse is speculative, and we cannot confidently use its point value without some idea of how uncertain it is. While some previous studies give confidence intervals on certain specific estimates 4,5 , these are not related to the uncertainties surrounding the actual effect sizes at specific times and locations. Here, we calculate uncertainties and their bias (for the lasso estimates) empirically on the basis of longer-term records from each of the stations at which we observed the eclipse, by performing our estimation procedure for any non-eclipse day and calculating the errors with respect to the true evolution of that day. The error distribution thus pertains to any arbitrary day of the year and includes uncertainties arising from annual-scale variability; in areas with a more pronounced annual cycle than the Coquimbo region, we would expect the estimates to exhibit larger uncertainties, which in turn could be counteracted by restricting the training **data** set to days closer to the day to be predicted (in terms of the day of year, DOY) if longer-term records are available."

The uncertainty induced by a non-co-located SODAR wind speed in the power curves can be seen in figures 3(c) and (d). When compared with the manufacturer's power curve, the SODAR-based power curves have lower Pearson's coefficient (r) values (r = 0.88-0.89) than the nacelle-based (r = 0.94-0.95). Furthermore, a small improvement (in terms of a higher r value and lower standard deviation of residuals) is evident from using the nacelle-adjusted 'true-flux' equivalent wind speed instead of the nacelle hub-height U ( figure 3(b)). Though small, these differences suggest that the nacelle-adjusted 'true-flux' equivalent wind speed generates the most accurate power curves at this site."

The **data** was analyzed in several ways including differences between parent and mutants strains in normal medium; in Na + -depleted medium; and metabolites that responded to Na + stress in parent or mutant. The p-values obtained from Two-Way ANOVA statistical analyses indicated whether differences were due to the effect of the rprY mutation or to Na + stress or both. Accordingly, as seen in Table 3, certain significant effects appeared to relate to the sodium status, e.g., in Na + stress, higher methionine sulfoxide, lower ketosphingosine, and more of certain dipeptides. Other effects appeared more related to RprY function than to Na + , e.g., in the mutant, higher undecanoate and lower thiamine. While it is difficult to make close connections of these changes with physiology (see Discussion), we here observe only that this initial analysis of a large number of metabolites from biosynthesis, catabolism and central metabolism reveals perturbations in relatively few of them in the four situations examined. Finally, we compared growth of a P. gingivalis oxyR mutant with that of the parent strain in Na + -depleted and normal media. As observed previously, the parent strain was able to grow in the Na +depleted medium while the oxyR mutant could not (Fig. 5), similar to the rprY mutant (Fig. 2). Since OxyR is a master regulator of genes involved in oxidative stress in Gram-negative bacteria [18], we infer that Na + depletion causes oxidative stress in the P. gingivalis cells."

Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination. We are aware that the magnitude of the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness announcements was influenced by the chosen dates."

They found that the algorithm reduced the network's overall throughput. To mitigate this problem, the authors proposed a contention-aware approach to the ADR. The solution used the gradient projection method to compute optimized **data** rate distributions that optimized throughput for each **data** rate group. This in turn reduced network contention and optimized the overall network throughput. The solution was evaluated using simulation representing the European ISM band with a one per cent duty cycle. The simulation networks consisted of 5 to 10,000 end devices each transmitting 50 to 100 bytes of data. The evaluation was based on throughput and its effectiveness was compared against the traditional ADR algorithm and to a version of the ADR with a balanced number of end devices (NEDs) in each **data** rate group. The proposed solution outperformed the traditional ADR algorithm in terms of overall network throughput, however, the solution performed poorly in terms of end device transmission success rate. Hence, in terms of transmission reliability, the solution still needs to be improved."

While our attempt exposes many limitations to the automated detection of dark patterns, it also offers valuable lessons on how we can make progress. Towards this goal, we have made our code, prediction models and **data** available for anyone to build upon our efforts. We argue that the automatic detection of dark patterns requires not only machine learning, but also refinement of the concept of dark patterns and consequently improvements in regulatory initiatives."
