In the 2014-2020 programming period, 239 Local Action Groups were funded, with a total budget of EUR 563 million [36]. The weak administrative capacity, the strong local negative political influences, and the high level of mistrust between actors inherited from the socialist era mostly explained the low LEADER success [31]. It has been noted that the policy instruments were inadequately implemented to local realities [37]. In addition, the quality of the LAG's Development Strategies was strongly influenced by the socio-economic **data** availability, proving to have low direct impacts especially in supporting the shift toward a low-carbon and climateresilient economy, and knowledge transfer and innovation [26]. Responding to the existing academic literature gaps on the LEADER approach, this paper aims to: (1) underline the most important tangible direct (non-LEADER) and indirect multiplier effects of the LAGs in Romania; (2) identify the enabling LAGs characteristics that can better maximize such multiplier effects in future rural development public policies; and (3) establish the conditions for maximizing the multiplication effects in future LEADER actions based on the awareness level of the LAGs managers. Thus, three hypotheses were formulated: H1 better multiplication results are obtained when the private and NGO partners are better engaged in the decision-making process of the Local Development Strategy; H2 LAGs with a larger and more experienced team are able to generate more consistent multiplication effects, by creating new projects supported from other non-LEADER funding; H3 more-experienced LAGs, with a greater capacity to involve partners, are generating better multiplier effects. The results can offer important insights and lessons regarding the implementation of Community-Led Local Development in countries with a weak participatory culture. LAGs should not act as one-off project but as an integral part in the sustainable development of European rural areas [5].

Furthermore, AF1 can be subdivided into two discrete, overlapping activation domains, the usage of which is context-dependent. Although almost the entire N terminus (residues 1-494) is required for full activity of the full-length receptor, a core that contributes 50% of the activity is located between residues 101 and 360, and this region has been termed TAU1. However, in the absence of the LBD, a different region mediates activation, and this region is termed TAU5 (residues 370 -494) (31) (Fig. 2A). We performed pulldown interaction assays to determine the interaction of full-length HEYL with full-length and deletion constructs of AR. These showed that GST-HEYL was able to interact strongly with full-length AR expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a robust interaction was also observed between full-length HEYL and GST-NTD, which contains the AR N-terminal domain (residues 1-556) but lacks the LBD and most of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), indicating that HEYL likely interacts with AR via the N-terminal transactivation domain (Fig. 2B). In support of this, no interaction was seen between HEYL and GST fused to the LBD in the presence or absence of ligand. To determine whether HEYL also represses AR-AF1 activity, we transfected COS-1 cells with an AR deletion construct lacking amino acids 654 -919 (AR⌬LBD), which is constitutively active. HEYL could significantly repress the activity of AR⌬LBD on TAT-GRE-E1B-LUC (Fig. 2C) and Probasin-LUC promoter constructs (data not shown). Together, these **data** indicate that HEYL interacts with and represses AR activity largely through AF1. To narrow down the functional domain affected, we next assayed the ability of HEYL to repress AR deletion constructs lacking either TAU1 (AR⌬1) or TAU5 (AR⌬5) (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S3). This showed that deletion of either domain resulted in reduced relative repression of AR activity by HEYL; however, the repression of AR⌬1 (with intact TAU5) by HEYL was proportionately less than that of AR⌬5 (with intact TAU1), indicating that TAU1 (residues 101-360) is likely to be the functional domain that is primarily affected by HEYL in the context of the full-length AR.",0,1,0,

Even though some of the host species might be small at the time of oviposition, canopy division **data** is able to provide further insight into this biological parameter.

For instance, while national surveys do provide information about number of children living in a household, they do not examine related sexuality issues such as the extent to which sex is viewed as a source of pleasure vs. simply as a procreational process (Pereira, 2003). Feminist scholars such as McFadden (2003) have (i) argued that sexuality needs to be conceptually distinguished from reproduction, (ii) demonstrated the relationship between power and sexual pleasure, and (iii) implied that the importance ascribed to female sexual pleasure, even in the context of legallysanctioned long-term, heterosexual, committed relationships, is an index of feminist choice.

Experimental endotoxicosis produces in the previously healthy individual a transient but significant systemic inflammatory response, characterized by fever, tachycardia, malaise, and a hepatic acute phase response.

Hence, while we can be certain that those values were at least aspirational in nature, there is no evidence permitting us to estimate the extent to which such values were in fact attained within traditional settings in Ghana's past. Additionally, proverbs are historically imprecise cultural artifacts since it is impossible to situate them in an exact period in history. Nevertheless, the proverbs provide us with a rough baseline from which to begin to estimate and understand the potential reach of social change.

The samples originated from the main geological areas around Turó de la Font de la Canya and provide a first overview of the strontium isotopic ranges from the vicinity of the site to 130 Km away to the West. The sampling of the Pleistocene sediments of the Vallès-Penedès valley proved challenging due to the high degree of human impact in this area, which prevented us to collect reliable samples. The strontium results from the large majority of the archaeological samples (27 out of  neighbouring Garraf mountains indicates that livestock was present in this coastal mountain area during the first millennium BC [62][63][64][65].

Only six teeth out of the 34 analysed have a strontium signature compatible with that of the Cretaceous limestones of the Garraf, despite their proximity (circa 4 km as the crow flies). Overall, the limited variability of strontium ratios points towards local rearing of caprines rather than longdistance trade of animals. The homogeneity of the strontium results contrast with the diversity of imports recovered from the site, which include Cruz del Negro pottery from the Straits of Gibraltar, Tanit figurines of Punic origin, a clay mask from the central or eastern Mediterranean, and numerous Campanian A ceramics from Italy in the levels dated from the 4 th and 3 rd centuries BC among others [20][21][22].

The first phase corresponded to vitamin C accumulation and while the second corresponded to the degradation of Vitamin C for both the conventional extraction and SEPA processes.

Organ culture is not a model for stroke per se, however it has been demonstrated to induce similar changes in vasoconstrictor responses, mRNA and protein expression of GPCRs, and intracellular Ca 2+ levels as observed after focal ischemia [15]. Therefore, organ culture is a convenient method to mimic the changes in vasoconstrictor responses to provide knowledge about vascular receptor upregulation in different tissues and insight into underlying mechanisms. Supporting this approach, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and Raf inhibitor SB-386023 attenuated upregulation of ET B receptors after organ culture in vitro [16], and after in vivo focal cerebral ischemia [13,14] and subarachnoid hemorrhage [17,18].

Because of this non-independence or autocorrelation, t-tests may not be able to detect the intervention effect adequately. Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA modeling, which not only features a quasiexperimental design, but also takes into consideration of the autoregressive moving-average process of the data, would produce statistically more rigorous findings. Based on the results of the augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, as well as examinations of both an auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF), ARIMA models for different types of policing activities were identified and analyzed.

Assuming that the grain sizes of AZ81 and AZ81+1.8 (Y+Sm) alloys are d 1 and d 2 , and the yield strengths are σ y1 and σ y2 , respectively, it can be obtained from the formula (2) that σ y1 = σ 0 + kd 1
 -1/2 (3) σ y2 = σ 0 + kd 2 -1/2
 (4) According to the above two formulas, it can be obtained as follows σ y2 -σ y1 = k (d 2 -1/2 -d 1 -1/2 ) (5) Combined with the above results of microstructure analysis (see Figure 1), the grain sizes d 1 =120 µm and d 2 =40 µm can be obtained by the linear intercept method. The k value of commonly used magnesium alloys is 280-320 MPa·µm 1/2 [1,2] , and here k = 300 MPa·µm 1/2 . By substituting these **data** into formula (5), the contribution of grain-refinement strengthening by Y and Sm to the yield strength of magnesium alloy AZ81 can be calculated as σ y2 -σ y1 = 300×(40 -1/2 -120 -1/2 ) = 20 MPa Combined with the above tensile test results (see Table 1), after the addition of 1.8%Y and Sm, the yield strength of AZ81 alloy is increased by 186 -144 = 42 MPa Among which, the contribution of grain-refinement strengthening is 20 MPa, accounting for 47.6% of the total increase of yield strength. Therefore, grain-refinement strengthening is a very important strengthening mechanism for magnesium alloys, and its contribution to the strength of magnesium alloys should be paid enough attention.",0,1,0,

Indigenous knowledge and education had an SoVI value of 2, which was of low vulnerability, contributing positively to resilience to drought. The study also found that government involvement in drought risk reduction is limited; as a result, the study recommends that a national, provincial and district municipalities policy on drought risk reduction and mitigation should be developed.

210839501,1/2,2,0.5,"Here, we propose a new method for the calculation of the average (scalar) polarizabilities of proteins based on their amino acid compositions, which utilizes the fact that objects with the same volume V and dielectric constant ɛ r have the same average polarizabilities α independent of shape, see also (1). The static dielectric constants are then calculated using the ClausiusÀ Mossotti relation. This method is computationally highly efficient and facilitated the calculations of the average polarizabilities and dielectric constants of all proteins in the protein **data** bank (PDB). [17] The average polarizability of a molecule can be calculated from the sum over hybridization configurations of the atoms in the molecule, [18] 
 a ¼ 4 N ð X A t A Þ 2 (2)
 with the number of electrons in the molecule N and the hybrid component τ A of each atom A, obtained by approximating the zeroth order wavefunction by an antisymmetrized product of molecular orbitals and spin functions. Average polarizabilities predicted by this method showed a very good agreement with experimental polarizabilities for more than 400 relatively small molecules with only~2 % error. Furthermore, since the atomic hybridizations of the atoms within the constituents amino acids do not change in proteins, (2) could be rearranged to obtain the average polarizability of a protein α p by summing over effective amino-acid hybrid components:
 a p ¼ 4 N p ð X aa t aa Þ 2(3)
 Here, N p is the number of electrons in the protein and τ aa are the hybridization components of amino acid aa, which are obtained as
 t aa ¼ ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi N aa a aa 2 p 2 (4)
 with the number of electrons N aa in an amino acid aa and its average polarizability α aa . The latter could be obtained from quantum-chemical calculations and, therefore, the values of τ not only include the summation of the atomic hybrid components within the amino acids, but also exchange correlation interactions at the level of quantum-chemistry employed. Furthermore, for (2) to be applicable for very polar compounds, τ A has to be modified to include the effect of the atoms to which A is bonded. However, τ aa already includes this effect since it reproduces the exact polarizabilities calculated from first principles.",0,1,0,

238581401,1/34,1,0.029,"Disulfiram (Antabuse), a drug used for almost 70 years to treat alcohol abuse, is an emerging candidate for repurposing in cancer therapy. Antitumor activity of disulfiram (DSF) is supported by numerous preclinical studies, case reports, and small clinical trials [1][2][3], yet clinical **data** from larger randomized trials are still lacking. Despite several promising case reports about durable remissions of advanced-stage cancer patients after DSF therapy [1,4,5], results from clinical trials are still limited and less favorable [6], a trend that is shared with other repurposed drugs [7]. The results from the few clinical trials available so far suggest that DSF´s anticancer effect may be limited to a subset of cancer patients [8,9], thereby raising a need for the identification of biomarkers that would help guide the patient selection in the future. A broader assessment of DSF in clinical oncology had been hindered mainly by the unknown identity of the active anticancer metabolite and its mechanism of action in cancer cells, including the key molecular target. Consequently, there is currently no reliable way to predict who among cancer patients is likely to benefit from the DSF treatment. In an effort to improve this situation, we have recently discovered that DSF is metabolized in the human body to bis-diethyldithiocarbamatecopper complex (CuET), that CuET represents the long-sought-after active compound that kills cancer cells, and that mechanistically, such toxicity to cancer cells reflects CuET-mediated impairment of NPL4, an essential cofactor of p97 segregase broadly involved in the degradation of cellular proteins [10,11]. We have also noticed that the CuET complex levels assessed after administration of the same dose of DSF vary significantly among patients [10]. We hypothesize that the observed variable clinical responses to DSF treatment might be attributable, at least in part, to the divergent extent of CuET formation, a process that is likely influenced by genetic and environmental factors, the latter including copper intake and the overall diet. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DSF treatment may be affected also by factors such as concomitant exposure to other drugs or pharmaceutically active compounds, a scenario particularly likely for advancedstage cancer patients. With the primary mechanism of anticancer activity of DSF known, the identification of such factors that impact cellular responses to DSF/ CuET is key to facilitate the repurposing of DSF in clinical oncology.",0,1,0,

6375277,2/16,2,0.125,"We estimated the activation of the transcription factors in our network over time using NCA ( Figure 1B). NCA decomposes a matrix containing gene expression values (E) into a matrix which represents the influence of a transcription factor on a target gene (strength matrix S) and a matrix which contains the transcription factor activities (activity matrix A) [8]. We found that both outputs of NCApredicted factor activities A and regulatory influences Shave added additional insights to gene expression **data** where the underlying regulatory network structure is partially known. Figure 2A and 2B show the estimated activities of our 10 transcription factors. Transcription factor activities clearly showed early-, mid-, and late-phase action in response to LPS. IRF3, NFKB1(p50/p105) and RELA (p60) were activated within 2 hours after the endotoxin was injected. IRF3 activation peaked at 2 hours and returned to its base level at 4 hours. NFKB1 and RELA were also activated early but decreased in activity more slowly. These three factors can induce expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, which then further activates the NF-B complex [25,26], and could contribute to the extended NF-B activation. JUN and FOS are known to be activated through the JNK pathway [30,31], and had a similar activation profile to NFKB1 and RELA. In contrast, STAT1, STAT3 and CREB1 exhibited a late-phase response. The STAT1 and STAT3 predictions correspond to previous findings that STATs are activated by cytokines transcribed by the NF-B complex [15]. It was surprising that predicted CREB1 activation peaked at four hours, given that previous reports detect phosphorylated CREB at 30 minutes [32]. However, the prediction was the result of late-phase induction of known CREB-dependent gene expression, such as ALAS1 and CEBPD [33,34]. Both STAT6 and MYC were predicted to be somewhat deactivated over nine hours. Deactivation of STAT6 was predicted due to repression of MHC-II class genes which are known to be regulated by STAT6 [35], as well as the expression of SOCS1, which has been reported to lead to deactivation of STAT6 [36]. MYC expression can be decreased through a STAT1-dependent pathway under IFN-γ stimulation conditions [37], and it is possible that the deactivation predicted here depends on STAT1 as well.",0,1,0,

Briefly, pairs of oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probes bind to their targeted protein, and if the two probes are brought in close proximity, the oligonucleotides hybridize in a pair-wise manner. The addition of a DNA polymerase leads to a proximity-dependent DNA polymerization event, generating a unique double-stranded DNA barcode for each specific antigen.

197564349,11/23,1,0.478,"One of the governing mechanisms for the colloidal behaviour of clays is isomorphous substitution, i.e. the exchange of cations of similar size and valence whilst the crystal structure is preserved. This process is completed during the formation of minerals and is the factor that determines the permanent charge of the mineral and thus its cation exchange capacity. Combined with the pore water chemistry, this permanent charge of the clay mineral governs the behaviour of the colloid system. Isomorphous substitution is significant in expandable minerals. Smectite minerals have high cation exchange capacities (CEC), in the range of 80-150 meq/100g [24] and are vulnerable to charge changes. Therefore, the emerging scale length in the SAXS **data** could be attributed to replacement of cations, especially from the interlayer exchangeable cations due to the new charge equilibrium of the global clay stacked structure. Large pore water gradients, and hence flow rates, present in the monotonic loading stages would not allow a stable ionic composition around the particles, required for an equilibrium state.

Ultra-short wavelengths of the order of 0.25-0.05 Å have been reported as being optimal for HPMX studies (Fourme et al., 2001). At AR-NW12A, the shortest wavelength available is 0.70 Å , limited by the cut-off ($ 3.5 mrad) of the focusing mirror reflectivity downstream of the monochromator, rather than by the X-ray undulator source (see Fig. 1 of Chavas et al., 2013).

Although sub-optimal, **data** collection at 0.70 Å should increase the crystal lifetime approximately by a factor of two, when compared with **data** collection at 1.00 Å , in accordance with calculations of the dose-dependent decay of crystals exposed to wavelengths of 0.70 Å and 1.00 Å , respectively, with a conserved incoming flux of 1.0 Â 10 11 photons s À1 mm À2 in an area of 200 mm Â 200 mm (calculations performed using Raddose version 2.0; Paithankar et al., 2009).

Following a significant correlation or t-test, we used linear or (in the case of PA variables) binary logistic regression with EF measures as predictors and academic, social, and global impairment measures as criterion variables, first controlling for IQ and then controlling for group status (ADHD vs. comparison), both of which were assessed at baseline. On the basis of these initial regressions, we reasoned that because IQ deficits are inherent to ADHD, controlling for both IQ and group concurrently would constitute overcontrol (see Miller and Chapman 2001). Thus, we emphasize findings with the more stringent covariate of group status (ADHD vs. comparison). Finally, following a significant regression analysis, we added the interaction term of the EF predictor x group status as the last step in the equation, to test for moderation by ADHD status.",0,1,0,

This can be explained by limitations in the measurement process. UV meter sensor can only cover a certain irradiance angle. Therefore, when measuring the UV intensity of two lamps symmetrically positioned on wall, it will not be able to cover the entire incident light, leading to a slight decrease in fluence rate.

 ICA is a **data** driven technique which decomposes fMRI **data** from linear mixed signals into spatially independent components. Components consist of a time course showing the temporal fluctuations of that component and a spatial map that shows the contribution of every voxel. A strength of ICA is that it is able to separate true neural networks and noise artifacts occurring in similar frequency ranges (Calhoun et al., 2001;van de Ven et al., 2004;Beckmann et al., 2005). Further, it has been shown that group ICA is able to characterize individual variation such that might occur across sessions and participants (Calhoun et al., 2001;Allen et al., 2012). The number of components was set to 25, in line with previous reports on low-order ICA for examining robust resting-state networks Zuo et al., 2010). The set of spatial maps from the groupaverage analysis was used to generate subject-specific versions of the spatial maps and associated time-series using spatiotemporal regression (Beckmann et al., 2009;Filippini et al., 2009).

Simultaneously, we mined the 2009 human genome build (GRCh37/hg19) for proviruses with high percent identity to HML-2, again using the K113 nucleotide sequence as a reference. For the 32 proviruses identified from the search, we performed an in silico restriction analysis as follows. About 5 kb of sequence was extracted in both directions from the start of the 5'LTR.

To estimate reaction time to the perceptual change, a replay experiment was conducted, in which the stimuli were physically modulated to simulate the perceptual time course recorded in the CFS experiment. To mimic the invisible phase, the wedge was physically removed. To mimic the visible phase, the wedge was presented to the nondominant eye and the contrast of the corresponding region of the Mondrian was decreased by a two-dimensional Gaussian window of full width at half maximum 5.5°, making the wedge visible. To mimic the perceptual switch, the contrasts of the stimuli were increased or decreased with a linear ramp of 200 ms. Subjects were instructed to report the visibility of the wedge as described in Subjects' task. Reaction time, from the end of the contrast increment or decrement to the key press, was measured. The reaction time **data** were pooled across subjects; reaction times longer than 2,000 ms were excluded. Median reaction times for the physical appearance and disappearance of the wedges were calculated separately (692 ms and 456 ms, respectively) and their distributions were modeled with ex-Gaussian functions ( Fig. 2E; appearance: ϭ 446.5, ϭ 186.6, ϭ 297.4; disappearance: ϭ 199.8, ϭ 94.6, ϭ 356.0; for details on ex-Gaussian function see Lacouture and Cousineau 2008;Saiki et al. 2011).

TOF measurement techniques have been well-established for several decades. In TOF, usually the prompt signature from the de-excitation of the reaction product is measured and used to generate a cross-section value. This approach involves different and also more sophisticated **data** processing procedures compared to AMS. The TOF **data** plotted here are based on measurements at ORELA ( 35 Cl, 40 Ca and 58 Ni) and n TOF/CERN ( 54 Fe and 58 Ni).

It has been shown by Capote and Neudecker [78] that when more than a one-dimensional quantity is to be evaluated (e.g., energy-dependent cross sections), the evaluated mean values, as well as the derived covariances, will be altered by the use of augmented covariance matrices that include the USU contributions. This is intuitively evident because a change in the inclusive **data** covariance matrix changes the effective weighings of the input **data** points and this will alter the evaluated mean values. Therefore, a-priori determined USU contribution (e.g., as done for a one-dimensional quantity 252 Cf(sf) ν tot , see Sect.

Experiments showed that the small bump shrinks as hydrogen concentration increases and eventually disappears when the sample approaches the trihydride.

Parity feature entails i) equal widgets, ii) equal number of times to either accept/reject/revoke consent, iii) across modalities (web, mobile and app setting levels) (Johanna Gunawan, 2021). This reasoning on feature parity needs still to be held definitive by court decisions as well for consistency in all EU.

These **data** permit reconstructing quantified past SSTs and salinities at two depths, i.e., 0 and 50 m, to infer thermocline migration for means calculated monthly, seasonally (according to the astronomical definition of seasons [26]), or annually. In this study, we performed calculations for the whole set of new parameters; however, here, we only report annual, winter (i.e., January-February-March) and summer (i.e., July-August-September) means, together with seasonal extremes (i.e., the warmest, August, and the coldest, February, month of the year). The derived errors (root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)) calculated for each reconstructed parameter were a maximum of 1.4 °C, for temperatures, and of 0.7 psu, for salinities (in August, at 0 m); these maximal error values are plotted on graphs hereafter.

Our transcriptome **data** show that several ethylene biosynthesis genes, such as S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACCO), were upregulated in the submerged roots. These results agree with previous studies showing that waterlogging stress promotes ethylene biosynthesis [52]. However, although ethylene biosynthesis genes were upregulated, waterlogging stress did not affect the downstream genes in the ethylene pathway, such as ETR, CTR1, and EIN3. Furthermore, although the increased EBF transcription could lead to EIN3 inhibition, this inhibition did not decrease the transcription of ERF TFs. Hence, we speculate that an EIN3-independent pathway might be involved in activating ERF TF transcription since there is growing evidence of the EIN3/EIL1-independent mediated pathway in the ethylene pathway. For example, the double knockout ein3ein1 Arabidopsis mutants were able to respond to ethylene under stress [53]. However, further studies are required to verify this.",0,1,0,
15434390,25/32,2,0.781,"Next, we showed that NOV regulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 in vivo and that these regulations are associated with altered pain intensity. In CFA rats, the siRNAmediated knockdown of NOV led to a specific upregulation of MMP-9 in the DRG and MMP-2 in the DHSC (and CCL2 in the DRG, **data** not shown), consistent with our in vitro data. Remarkably, endogenously produced NOV depletion resulted in increased tactile hypersensitivity. The compatible pattern of MMP-2/-9 and NOV expression at the late phase of inflammatory pain further raises the possibility that NOV reduction could specifically lead to transient MMP-9 induction in the DRG and a persistent increase of MMP-2 expression in the spinal cord, thereby contributing to the maintenance of pain. Admittedly, NOV is likely to act in concert with other specific partners of a given neuroinflammatory environment to modulate MMP-2/-9 expression. This is supported by our **data** showing NOV modulation of cytokine activities in vitro and cytokines induction at a late phase of inflammatory pain. In addition, NOV reduction at a late phase of the development of inflammatory pain contrasts with the early development of pain hypersensitivity indicating that NOV might not be involved in the early stage of pain induction but be required at a later precise time slot during pain pathogenesis. Even though the NOV-null mouse has been generated recently, its nervous system phenotype has not yet been reported. The NOV-null mouse shows normal development but enhanced neointimal hyperplasia in response to endothelial injury [48]. Our **data** thus reinforce the idea that NOV is highly important in tissue homeostasis especially in case of injury [24] and further highlight the interest of investigating pain symptoms in NOV-null mice. These findings indicate that endogenous NOV may have an important function in limiting the deleterious effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines particularly on MMPs expression in the nociceptive system.",0,1,0,

This enhanced expression is clear one day after transfer to media containing NaCl and is apparently lost after 7 days of the transfer. These results indicate that a higher level of expression of genes involved in the responses to osmotic stress is critical during the early stages of the response to osmotic stress. The finding that expression of PYL4, ABI5, and AAO3 is significantly higher in seedlings grown in media containing NaCl and Ti than in those grown in media containing NaCl without Ti, confirms that Ti activates the expression of genes involved in osmotic stress, but also that to maintain a higher level of expression requires the continuous presence of Ti.",0,1,0,

52879579,10/19,1,0.526,"According to preclinical studies, GABA B receptors modulate anxiety and depression-related behaviors (21), and baclofen may induce better results among AUD patients affected by anxiety and/or mood disorders through a reduction of the severity of these disorders. The present narrative mini-review was aimed at investigating the role of psychiatric comorbidity in explaining potential different responses to baclofen treatment among AUD patients. The results show that the majority of AUD patients treated with baclofen and described by the case reports, as well as the observational and retrospective studies, suffered from anxiety and/or mood disorders. This finding agrees with **data** of large epidemiological studies (14,60). However, the results of the present review also show that, despite these disorders being common among AUD patients, patients with severe mental disorders (including severe anxiety and mood disorders) were excluded by the randomized, controlled, trials (RCTs) conducted to evaluate the efficacy of baclofen to treat AUD. Therefore, these results do not allow us o evaluate whether baclofen efficacy is different in AUD patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders compared to those without. One RCT found that baclofen administration reduced alcohol consumption in anxious patients, but not in patients with low levels of anxiety (55). However, in this study, baclofen administration did not significantly reduce anxiety levels. A recent meta-analysis also found no difference between baclofen and placebo in reducing both depression and anxiety levels among AUD patients (64). The results of the present review may be useful to better understand these results. Indeed, both these studies (55,64) evaluated the efficacy of baclofen in modifying the severity of anxiety or depression among AUD patients not affected by severe mental disorders. In addition, the RCTs used different scales to measure the severity of anxiety and/or depression, such as self-reported rating scales (e.g., STAI, BDI, and ZUNG) and interviewer-rated scales (e.g., HAM-A, HAM-D, and MADRS). The exclusion of patients with severe mental disorders, and the variability in the scales adopted, prevents current meta-analyses to evaluate potential differences in baclofen efficacy in reducing the severity of the comorbid mental disorders. To reduce the variability, the interviewer-rated scales should be used rather than self-reported rating scales (65,66). Accordingly, it is desirable that future RCTs investigate the efficacy of baclofen in AUD patients affected by other mental disorders, using interviewer-rated scales to establish the effects on the severity of anxiety and/or depression.",0,1,0,
