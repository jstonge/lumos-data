One wonders if Rad17p might be able to form PCNA-like homotrimeric structures as originally suggested (40). However, MEC3 expressed from a multicopy plasmid does neither enhance nor reduce Rad17p-Rad17p interaction and thus no indication for a competition between different Rad17p-containing complexes was found (data not shown). Alternatively, the **data** are also consistent with a simultaneous complex formation of Rad17p with itself and Mec3p. One could envision multimeric aggregate formation of a PCNA-ring-like Rad17p⅐Mec3p⅐Ddc1p complex on DNA, mediated by Rad17p homomeric interactions. We currently favor this hypothesis because Rad17p but also Mec3p self-interactions have been indicated for the human homologues (hRad1, hHus1, Ref. 46), thus possibly hinting at an evolutionary conserved capability of the heterotrimer to form higher order complexes. On the other hand, protein elution profiles in S. pombe did not indicate any shift in Hus1 protein association following DNA damage by ionizing radiation (44).

A key ingredient in an event study involves the date(s). Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination.

First, in contrast to a clinical diagnosis, the CES-D measures past-week depressive symptoms which may vary over time due to the scale's sensitivity to reactions to life events and individual-level cycles of symptomology (Radloff, 1977). However, the CES-D has shown adequate test-retest validity for intervals of up to 12 months (Radloff, 1977) which supports its use in longitudinal studies conducted previously on this topic (Adjibade et al., 2018;Akbaraly et al., 2013;Le Port et al., 2012;Vermeulen et al., 2018). Second, while we included current use of antidepressants in the outcome to indicate depression in the absence of symptoms, there are important limitations to this measure. Some antidepressant medications are prescribed for other conditions like chronic pain and anxiety, and we were unable to distinguish these indications from clinical depression. Additionally, prescribing practices may have changed over time, so **data** on antidepressant use may not reflect the underlying presence of depression in the population. However, antidepressant use has been included in previous studies of the diet-depression relationship (Chocano-Bedoya et al., 2013;Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2015), and our sensitivity analysis that omitted antidepressants from the outcome did not produce materially different results from our primary analysis.

By examining extraction of ␣-DG with SDS, we show that disruption of proper SG-SSPN protein interactions within the sarcolemma of SSPN-Tg muscle results in destabilization of ␣-DG. The role of ␣-DG in organization of the extracellular matrix has been well-established (Brown et al., 1999;Henry and Campbell, 1998;Henry et al., 2001;Kanagawa et al., 2005). We now show that SSPN overexpression disrupts formation of the extracellular matrix, as revealed by uncoupling of perlecan, laminin and collagen VI co-localization and as seen by electron microscopy. Laminins represent one of the major components of the extracellular matrix and mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which encodes laminin-␣2 chain, cause congenital MD (Allamand et al., 1997;Helbling-Leclerc et al., 1995;Miyagoe-Suzuki et al., 2000).

In this regard, metalloporphyrins are electrochemically well-studied systems owing to their unique d-electron configurations relative to the porphyrin macrocycle core 79,80 . Morris and co-workers have prepared CoPIZA\/FTO by growing the CoPIZA MOF from TCPP(Co III ) linker and Co II -carboxylate node on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode 81 . These films showed catalytic activity for carbon tetrachloride reduction. Interestingly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic **data** collected for these MOF-modified electrodes revealed a conductivity of 3.62 × 10 −8 S cm −1 -a behavior that may have been augmented by the redox contribution from both the struts and Co nodes. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of CoPIZA (@FTO) evinced two reversible cathodic peaks at −1.1 and −1.45 V (vs ferrocyanide) corresponding to TCPP(Co III\/II ) and TCPP(Co II\/I ), respectively. Interestingly, Co III SBU shows similar redox potential values at −0.87 and −1.39 V corresponding to Co III\/II and Co II\/I redox processes, respectively. The current density and the cathodic-anodic peak separation of these redox events were found to be scan-rate dependent, and therefore, the charge transport rate (k CT ) in this diffusion-limited process can be expressed in terms of the diffusion coefficient (D hop~7 .55 × 10 -14 cm 2 s −1 ). Hod's group reported tuning redox conductivity by engineering the defect site density with iron porphyrin ligands in a UiO-66 type MOF 82 . The Zr nodes with varying degrees of missing linker (and the corresponding void space) were used to install Fe-porphyrin (Hemin) molecules via SALI. These hemindecorated UiO-66 MOFs were used to probe the hopping rate as a function of porphyrin loading (i.e., originally the defect density) that defines the variable (average) Fe-Fe distances. Transient electrochemical **data** revealed that the higher hemin-loaded (i.e., a shorter d Fe-Fe ) samples manifest a low diffusion rate and the maximum diffusion rate was obtained for relatively lower heminloaded samples. Considering microporous UiO-66 system, a highly defective sample that led to high hemin loading allowed the decoration deep within MOF crystal, which seemed to impede the mass transport of the counterions. Whereas, in low-defect samples, the hemins mostly reside at the surface and therefore suppress the mass transport-related issues."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.797406Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T18:56:19.246296Z","inner_id":17,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18,"annotations":[{"id":18,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"8lKlLO6Er-","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:56:38.831111Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T18:56:38.831143Z","lead_time":19.391,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":18,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":1520137,"section":"10\/35","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.286,"text":"It is in principle possible that the bias in the observers' reports did not arise from the inference stage (which gives P(yes j C t ), or more strictly, P(yes j x t )), but from the subsequent decision stage, when a threshold value P th is chosen such that a response ''yes'' or ''no'' is given if P(yes j x t ) .

Without any insight on how contexts bias the decision threshold P th , the decision bias has to be modelled by introducing one model parameter for each contextual condition (defined by a particular combination of the configuration and contrast C c of the context), in addition to the model parameters for the unbiased inference P(yes j C t ) or P(yes j x t ) shared by all contextual conditions. Hence decision bias is a less parsimonious model to account for our **data** since it would require more model parameters than our model of inference bias. In addition, other than a numerical value P th , the decision bias does not give any insight in why and how the decision should be biased by context when the inference is unbiased.

We started by evaluating how YM-201636 could affect the subcellular distribution of K18 PFFs in neurons. We treated primary hippocampal neurons with either 1% DMSO or 1 μM YM-201636 followed by incubation with AF488-labeled K18 PFFs for 16 h to allow internalization and transport into EDITORS' PICK: PIKfyve mediates tau aggregates transport and its seeding lysosomes. As mentioned before, LAMP1-positive organelles in neurons treated with YM-201636 appeared enlarged and reduced in number when compared with DMSO control (Fig. S8B). While there were no changes in the amount of K18 PFFs being internalized by neurons, the percentage of both K18 and FL Tau PFFs colocalizing with LAMP1 vesicles was reduced by 50% after YM-201636 treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). XYZ projection imaging shows that the majority of K18 PFFs can be seen close to LAMP1-positive vesicles, but not inside (Fig. S8A). On the other hand, K18 PFFs are slightly increased in number in EEA1-positive vesicles as well, thus pointing to a partial trapping or delayed transit of labeled K18 PFFs in earlier endosomal compartments. Because an absence of K18 PFFs in lysosomes could potentially be explained by an increased degradative capacity, we investigated lysosomal proteolytic activity. We used DQ-BSA, a self-quenchable substrate for hydrolase activity that, following endocytic uptake and delivery to degradative compartments, produces fluorescence upon cleavage. The intensity of DQ-BSA positive vesicles was decreased by 27% when primary hippocampal cultures were treated with 1 μM YM-201636, thus indicating reduced transport of cargo into proteolytic vesicles and consequently lowered degradation of substrates and excluding increased hydrolytic activity (Fig. 6G). YM-201636 treatment also reduced the number of cathepsin B-and D-positive vesicles, corroborating the DQ-BSA **data** and the idea of impaired degradation capacity in neurons (Fig. 6, H and I)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.798457Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:16:00.649810Z","inner_id":30,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":31,"annotations":[{"id":31,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"rMYzdiQe9Z","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T19:16:10.485165Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:16:10.485198Z","lead_time":9.491,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":31,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":1441955,"section":"18\/51","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.353,"text":"In our study, xanthohumol in a concentration of 25 and after 2 and 8 h incubation of LNCaP cancer cells alone did not affect the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bid and Bax.

Even MKK10 have an atypical S\/T-X 5 -S\/T motif show detectable expression, indicating that they possibly have a new function other than becoming silenced. It is interesting that the expression of AtMKK10 is much higher in pollen compared with other tissues. Arabidopsis MKKs genetically exhibit the crosstalk in a variety of signaling pathways, therefore, a single mkk mutant under normal growth conditions is very difficult to obtain a specific phenotype [43]. A previous study showed that the ap1-15, ap2-6, ap3-6, ag-12, clv3-7, lfy-12 and ufo-1 mutants involve with flower development, whereas AtMKK10 was down regulated in these mutants (Fig. 6b), consistent with their expression in the flower.

To understand better the mechanism(s) of repression of AR by HEY proteins, we examined the subcellular distribution of HEYL protein by confocal microscopy with a monoclonal antibody. In normal and benign transformed prostate epithelial lines, RWPE-1 and BPH-1, respectively, endogenous HEYL was entirely nuclear (Fig. 7A). In our inducible LNCaP:HEYL cell line treated with doxycycline, the exogenously expressed HEYL was also nuclear, demonstrating that the transfected HEYL behaves similarly to endogenous protein, and furthermore, we observed a co-localization of HEYL and AR in the nucleus of these cells in the presence of androgen (Fig. 7A, bottom panel). In addition, we verified the specificity of the HEYL antibody by immunofluorescence and Western blotting of LNCaP:HEYL cells treated with or without doxycycline (Fig. 7A). To examine expression patterns of endogenous HEYL in human prostate tissue, we used prostate needle biopsies from patients with prostate cancer and stained them for HEYL. As shown in Fig. 7B, endogenous HEYL was expressed in the epithelial cell compartment of the prostate and showed nuclear localization in benign cells (Fig. 7B, left panels) with little expression detected in the cytoplasm. However, in all stages of cancer examined, HEYL nuclear intensity decreased, in most cases correlating with increasing cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 7, B and C). The expression score for each patient is plotted in Fig. 7C. This shows that nuclear expression decreased in all stages of the disease studied but remained high in adjacent benign tissue. Furthermore, expression of HEYL in the cytoplasm remained low in adjacent tissue but at the same level or higher in prostate cancer.

This dimension accounted for 26% of the total variation and suggests that, while the combined items provide an adequate general measure of severity, there is a distinction between signs related to nerve function and other signs of reaction.

Our coding system gave approximately equal weight to skin involvement and recent changes in nerve function. Does this reflect the relative clinical importance of these two groups of items? Given the longer-term implications of nerve impairment, is there a case for giving additional weight to items reflecting recent change in nerve function? Would this make the scale less sensitive to visible symptoms of reaction that may be the primary concern of the affected person?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.799769Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:19:15.243957Z","inner_id":48,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":49,"annotations":[{"id":49,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["data availability statement"]},"id":"cw7_dIqKmI","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T19:19:27.664570Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:19:27.664607Z","lead_time":12.243,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":49,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":130484012,"section":"3\/4","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.75,"text":"\nto the same scales as the soluble silica. 1 In what follows numerical **data** relating to the Chalk, unless otherwise stated, have been obtained from A.

Furthermore, von Schacky and Weber demonstrated in a small uncontrolled study that DHA had a greater antithrombotic effect (via reduced platelet responsiveness) compared to EPA in healthy volunteers after just six days of 6 g\/day EPA or DHA [45]. Both EPA and DHA are able to displace a proportion of AA in platelet membrane phospholipids, thus decreasing the amount of AA-derived pro-aggregatory mediators such as TXA 2 that are formed from the metabolism of AA by COX-2 [2]. EPA is also a substrate for COX-2, resulting in synthesis of weaker pro-aggregatory mediators such as TXA 3 . Both EPA and AA also form equipotent prostacyclins PGI 3 and PGI 2 , respectively, which inhibit platelet aggregation. Thus, the overall effect of EPA and DHA is to create a less thrombogenic environment [2]. This competitive displacement of AA is supported by the strong association of DHA's positive effect on platelet aggregation with decreases in platelet-derived TXB 2 , an inactive metabolite of AA-derived TXA 2 [65]. This may also be due to DHA's competitive inhibition of COX-2 or to the inhibition of TXA 2 synthetase or TXA 2 receptor function [23]."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.800196Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:20:36.140218Z","inner_id":54,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":55,"annotations":[{"id":55,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"PXUTbYADCj","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T19:20:49.626533Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:20:49.626568Z","lead_time":13.294,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":55,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":15434390,"section":"26\/32","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.812,"text":"Altogether, our findings reveal a role for NOV in the modulation of CFA-induced pain by exerting antiinflammatory and anti-allodynic effects. Our study provides for the first time evidence that, besides their recently demonstrated roles in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, MMP-2\/-9 could be involved in chronic inflammatory pain as well. We hypothesize that, during chronic inflammation, NOV downregulation in DRG and spinal cord contributes to MMP-2\/-9 induction thereby participating in the maintenance of pain intensity. Because NOV appears as a novel mediator in the functional interplay between cytokine and MMPs in pain processes, it may alone or in concert with other drugs represent a new interesting analgesic. Knowing that recent evidence renders MMP-2\/-9 useful targets for neuropathic pain relief [56], the investigation of NOV involvement in neuropathic pain would be worthwhile research, and preliminary **data** from our laboratory in this matter appear promising.

Thus male and female arteries had similar ET A -mediated responses, but female arteries showed little or no response via the high affinity ET B receptor. It should be noted that three of the male patient samples demonstrated no or weak ET B receptor-specific vasoconstriction. Although the reason for these observations cannot be explained, medication history and age of these patient samples were not any different from the patient samples showing strong ET B receptor-mediated vasoconstriction."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.808225Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:22:01.504664Z","inner_id":61,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":62,"annotations":[{"id":62,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"ciadY3C0wF","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T19:22:09.051275Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:22:09.051308Z","lead_time":7.364,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":62,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":57759233,"section":"14\/28","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.5,"text":"The effects of tDCS can be evaluated through changes in cortical excitability using single-pulse TMS [21].

Both have provided excellent biological insights in multiple investigations and likely will continue to do so, particularly when profiling with LC-MS, despite notable recent improvement (37), cannot presently provide the necessary sample throughput.

The expression of heat shock proteins is tightly controlled by both positive and negative regulation [36,37]. The expression of several of HSP chaperones is maintained at basal levels by mechanisms that include negative feedback loops [38] and blocking of promoters by CIRCE sequences and negative regulators [39]. Positive regulation is achieved by expression of alternate sigma factors [36].

While we previously suggested CME in the neuronal uptake of Tau because of the demonstrated role of Bin1 (14), our current **data** prove that unequivocally clathrin does not play a role. Selectively inhibiting downstream effectors of Rac1 involved in actin polymerization and endocytosis, including Arp2\/3, N-WASP, and PAK1, did not reduce tau seeds internalization. As mentioned before, clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent endocytosis as well as macropinocytosis has been proposed previously as a mechanism by which tau aggregates are internalized by cell lines (16,17) or human neurons (18). The **data** presented here show that also in neurons, several proteins that are part of the core machineries involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis or macropinocytosis, such as dynamin1, actin, and Rac1, are involved in the uptake of Tau seeds. However, molecular players functioning in macropinocytosis, like PAK1, could not be linked to tau seeds uptake (58,59).

The **data** was analyzed in several ways including differences between parent and mutants strains in normal medium; in Na + -depleted medium; and metabolites that responded to Na + stress in parent or mutant. The p-values obtained from Two-Way ANOVA statistical analyses indicated whether differences were due to the effect of the rprY mutation or to Na + stress or both. Accordingly, as seen in Table 3, certain significant effects appeared to relate to the sodium status, e.g., in Na + stress, higher methionine sulfoxide, lower ketosphingosine, and more of certain dipeptides. Other effects appeared more related to RprY function than to Na + , e.g., in the mutant, higher undecanoate and lower thiamine. While it is difficult to make close connections of these changes with physiology (see Discussion), we here observe only that this initial analysis of a large number of metabolites from biosynthesis, catabolism and central metabolism reveals perturbations in relatively few of them in the four situations examined. Finally, we compared growth of a P. gingivalis oxyR mutant with that of the parent strain in Na + -depleted and normal media. As observed previously, the parent strain was able to grow in the Na +depleted medium while the oxyR mutant could not (Fig. 5), similar to the rprY mutant (Fig. 2). Since OxyR is a master regulator of genes involved in oxidative stress in Gram-negative bacteria [18], we infer that Na + depletion causes oxidative stress in the P. gingivalis cells."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.813606Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:40:22.473606Z","inner_id":104,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":105,"annotations":[{"id":104,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"yjA68CXxei","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:40:28.355026Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:40:28.355065Z","lead_time":5.71,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":105,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":201197877,"section":"1\/18","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.056,"text":"Author contributions: LAC, DAP conceived the study and wrote the manuscript; LAC analyzed the data; NP contributed to the methods used and **data** collection on algae, including cyanobacteria; RR assigned reproductive rates of species."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.813706Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:40:28.393878Z","inner_id":105,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":106,"annotations":[{"id":105,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"p-_hzWb680","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:40:43.044363Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:40:43.044400Z","lead_time":14.463,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":106,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":25826755,"section":"7\/22","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.318,"text":"from experiments using Fura-2-loaded canine airway smooth muscle cells grown to confluence then serum deprived in insulin-supplemented medium for 7 days.

So far, no characterization of MMPs expression in the CFA model of inflammatory pain has been carried out. Thus, we first examined MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression patterns in the DRG and DHSC during CFA-induced inflammatory pain. As shown in Figure  8A and 8B, MMP-9 mRNA levels were transiently upregulated in DRG on days 15 (×3.95 ± 0.55, **P < 0.01, n = 4) and 21 (×2 ± 0.36, *P < 0.05, n = 4) as well as in the DHSC 15 days (×2.8 ± 0.6, *P < 0.05, n = 4) after CFA injection, and returned to levels of sham rats thereafter. Markedly, MMP-2 expression showed no variation in DRG, but a mean 2-fold persistent upregulation in DHSC at late stages (×3.45 ± 0.66 on day 15; ×2 ± 0.66 on day 21 and × 1.94 ± 0.36 on day 60 post-CFA, *P < 0.05, n = 4). Moreover, dexamethasone treatment at late stages of inflammatory pain repressed MMP-2\/-9 expression in DRG and DHSC of CFA rats ( Figure 8C and 8D, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, n = 4). Thus, the induction of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mirrors reduced NOV expression at late stages in the establishment of inflammatory pain ( Figure 3A and 3B). In an acute model of inflammatory pain, carrageenaninduced mechanical allodynia is partially prevented in MMP-9-null mice [ [10], suppl. data]. To test whether MMP-9 could impact CFA-induced persistent inflammatory pain, the mechanical allodynia of CFA rats treated with an MMP-9 inhibitor (MMP-9i) was evaluated using the von Frey filament test. As shown in Figure 8E, repeated intrathecal injections of MMP-9 inhibitor from day 9 to day 12 post-CFA injection significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia (5.5 ± 0.8 g in CFA rats treated with MMP-9i compared to 2.7 ± 0.3 g in CFA rats injected with vehicle, **P < 0.01, n = 6).

These **data** are similar to those reported for other plant species showing that Ti enhances the accumulation of different elements in plant tissues (Konishi and Tsuge, 1936;Carvajal and Alcaraz, 1995;Frutos et al., 1996;Wojcik and Wojcik, 2001;Hrubýet al., 2002;Alcaraz-Lopez et al., 2004;Haghighi et al., 2012;Kleiber and Markiewicz, 2013;Servin et al., 2013;Daghan et al., 2020;Ghazi et al., 2021). The increase of the content of essential elements in Ti-treated Arabidopsis plants correlates well with our RNA-seq **data** that shows that several genes encoding N, K, S, and divalent cations transporters, as well as P-starvation responsive genes are activated by Ti treatment ( Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S5). The enhanced Pi content and the reduction in the uptake of toxic elements such as Al, and Cd could be explained by the increased expression of genes encoding organic acid transporters in Titreated plants. Organic acid exudation has been shown to enhance Pi uptake and ameliorate Al toxicity by preventing its entry into the root (Hocking, 2001;Barcelóand Poschenrieder, 2002;Santos et al., 2014). Our **data** shows that the root exudates of Ti-treated plants have a higher capacity to solubilize Pi from insoluble compounds and higher chelation of metallic ions (Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggest that treatment with 2 mM Ti enhances plant nutrition which is reflected in better growth. However, as we described before, higher Ti concentrations (8 mM) have a drastic effect on Arabidopsis growth, which could be due to a direct toxic effect of Ti or an indirect effect mediated by an exacerbated accumulation of some elements in the plant such as Na or Fe. According to White and Brown (2010), Na, Cl, B, Fe, and Mn are toxic at high concentrations. Considering that in Ti-treated plants the increased Pi accumulation was directly correlated with the amount of Ti applied ( Figure 1C, D), other elements may be hyperaccumulated at high Ti concentrations. This elemental hyperaccumulation could be responsible, at least in part, of the toxic effect of Ti at high concentrations."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.814948Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:44:15.213819Z","inner_id":115,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":116,"annotations":[{"id":115,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"jqhM9D_1Mv","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:44:22.787064Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:44:22.787102Z","lead_time":7.402,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":116,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":196543150,"section":"13\/17","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.765,"text":"Currently, there is a lack of validation studies to bring source space connectivity into clinical practice. Even M\/EEG source localization is still only performed in a modest number of centers worldwide, e.g., in the E-PILEPSY consortium electromagnetic source localization is only used at 12 out of 25 centers in the presurgical evaluation (85). Calculating source space connectivity is more complex than source localization alone. Given that the integration of source localization has already proven to be difficult in clinical practice, it can be anticipated that this will be an even larger challenge for source space connectivity. First, well designed prospective studies should show that source space connectivity has clear added value compared to the visual analysis of the electrophysiologist today on a patient specific level. Later, the methods should be available in standardized software with appropriate clearance for clinical use. Software for clinical use must come along with high usability, so that clinical-technical staff can do the necessary steps of processing (a) without risk of running into pitfalls that are common in source imaging and (b) within a workable time range, which is notoriously limited in clinical contexts. Next to this, standardized paradigms must be defined and tested, similarly to neuropsychological tests, in order to determine whether eloquent areas can be mapped by source connectivity analysis in pre-surgical evaluation. These paradigms must take into account the fact that network analyses require temporal information. Indeed, source-level connectivity needs different **data** properties than simple source-transformation of single events such as peaks of event related components.

We found that SSPN perturbed both types of interactions in SSPN-Tg muscle.

FNAB is the best way for the diagnosis of cancer in patients presenting with thyroid nodules [5,6]. FNA cytology reports are classified as: Benign, Follicular lesion of undetermined significance and Follicular neoplasm, Suspicious for malignancy, Malignant and Nondiagnostic [26]. Unlike for papillary thyroid cancer, FNA biopsy cannot differentiate follicular thyroid cancer from follicular adenomas. These specimens are usually reported as indeterminate lesions, categorized as follicular neoplasm or follicular lesions of undetermined significance [7,8]. Pathologic evaluation of the thyroid after surgery confirms the actual diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer. Treatment in benign and malignant group is straightforward, but in patients with cytology suggesting follicular neoplasm is controversial. Physicians usually perform thyroid scintigraphy and most patients with non autonomous adenomas should undergo surgery because 15 to 25 percent of them prove to be cancers [26]. Many procedures are under investigation to improve the diagnostic value of cytology alone for the assessment of follicular neoplasm. These include RT-PCR measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA, PET scans, cellular and molecular markers [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19].

Many studies have shown higher incidence of thyroid cancer in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, compared with control population [27,28]. Elevated TSH due to continuous progression to hypothyroidism in Hashimoto's disease and TSH receptor stimulation by TSH receptor antibody in Graves' disease may explain the higher rate of malignancy in these patients. The trophic effect of TSH on thyroid cancer growth also is well established [29,30] and TSH suppression by administering exogenous thyroid hormone is an independent predictor of recurrence of differentiated thyroid cancer [31].

We propose that SSPN (green) overexpression at the sarcolemma (1) causes clustering of the SGs (yellow) into insoluble aggregates (2). Perturbation of the SG-SSPN subcomplex within the DGC impairs its ability to properly anchor ␣-DG (red) at the sarcolemma (3). The destabilization of ␣-DG attachment to the sarcolemma leads to perturbation of basement membrane (blue) assembly (4). It is feasible that disruption of the basement membrane leads to aberrant cellular signaling (5), which may be responsible for the increased levels of apoptosis in phenotypic SSPN-Tg mice. By this pathogenetic mechanism, SSPN disrupts protein interactions within and across the membrane bilayer leading to a severe phenotype that is reminiscent of congenital MD."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.821673Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:47:12.686416Z","inner_id":124,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":125,"annotations":[{"id":124,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"7d1hsZb0rD","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:47:24.220087Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:47:24.220118Z","lead_time":11.364,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":125,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":1950628,"section":"15\/21","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.714,"text":"We also demonstrated incremental diagnostic value of LA STE measurements over established risk stratification scale in identifying patients with LAAT.

Our transcriptome **data** show that several ethylene biosynthesis genes, such as S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACCO), were upregulated in the submerged roots. These results agree with previous studies showing that waterlogging stress promotes ethylene biosynthesis [52]. However, although ethylene biosynthesis genes were upregulated, waterlogging stress did not affect the downstream genes in the ethylene pathway, such as ETR, CTR1, and EIN3. Furthermore, although the increased EBF transcription could lead to EIN3 inhibition, this inhibition did not decrease the transcription of ERF TFs. Hence, we speculate that an EIN3-independent pathway might be involved in activating ERF TF transcription since there is growing evidence of the EIN3\/EIL1-independent mediated pathway in the ethylene pathway. For example, the double knockout ein3ein1 Arabidopsis mutants were able to respond to ethylene under stress [53].

However, the transcriptional levels in PtMKKs have a great difference, while maize is not obvious (Additional file 19). To further validate the transcripts of B. distachyon MKK genes in different tissues, we tested five different tissues that were a part of Bd21 seedling, root, leaf, stem and young caryopsis, to analyze the tissue specific expression patterns of MKK genes (Additional file 20). The results revealed that all except BdMKK10-4 are expressed in five different tissues and BdMKK6 and BdMKK10-2 have higher transcriptional levels in young caryopsis than other tissues (Additional file 20).

Not as expected, MPK6 can be phosphorylated by OsMKK10-2 which have the kinase activity [28]. Moreover, we surveyed the gene expression of MKK under abiotic stresses that public microarray **data** of Arabidopsis under wound, drought, genotoxic, cold, osmotic, high-salinity, heat, oxidative and UV-B treatment were collected (Fig. 6d). Many plant MKK genes are up-regulated upon UV-B treatment, including AtMKK4 and AtMKK5. These results indicated that plant MKK genes may be involved in UV-B related signaling. To validate the expression profile of plant MKK genes in UV-B signaling, we performed the RT-qPCR experiments on RNA collected from different time points of B. distachyon plants under UV-B treatments. The results revealed that many MKK genes are up-regulated upon UV-B treatment, including BdMKK4 and BdMKK10-5, especially BdMKK10-5 originally have low-level transcripts in B. distachyon tissue (Additional file 20).

However, the distances between sarcolemma of adjacent myofibers appeared to be greater in the SSPN-Tg muscle compared with non-Tg controls (white arrows, Fig. 9A,B). Photomicrographs of the sarcolemma taken at higher magnification show that the extracellular matrix in SSPN-Tg muscle is characterized by randomly placed, unorganized dense clumps (black arrows, Fig. 9B). By contrast, the extracellular matrix from non-Tg muscle appeared to be a tight, linear structure that was closely aligned in a parallel fashion with the sarcolemma (Fig. 9B). The disorganization of the basement membrane in SSPN-Tg muscle may account for the larger spacing between neighboring myofibers.

Interestingly, polyhydroxyalkanoate production decreased the oxidative stress response in a psychrophilic Pseudomonas species by modulating the levels of reducing equivalents [29]. Thiamine levels were approximately five-fold lower in the mutant strain than in the parent, another effect of the rprY mutation. A link between thiamine and oxidative stress was provided by the observation that thiamine supplementation restored the growth of Salmonella enterica on paraquat, a superoxide-generator, the interpretation being that oxidative stress directly caused the thiamine requirement [30].

Strikingly, the activities of all of these drugs are similar in the two cell lines, suggesting that the activity is cell-type independent, inhibiting the same target using the same mechanism of action.

Advances in bioinformatics have dramatically improved metabolomic **data** processing [158,159], but, despite this, thousands of signals remain unidentified [160]. Thus, metabolomics could have a much greater impact, with the development of improved annotation workflows and more comprehensive plant metabolite libraries. Machine learning now plays a significant role in metabolomics (LC-MS being routinely utilized [161]). It predicts a vast array of molecular properties and processes, such as adduct species, MS fragmentation, MS\/MS deconvolution, and chromatographic retention time [158,159,162]. However, it must still be noted that, due to the vast numbers of closely related isomeric compounds in plants, as well as their derivatives decorated with varying isomeric sugar moieties or fused with amino acids, which produce near-identical MS\/MS and MS n fragmentation patterns, and which co-elute even with long (60 > min) UHPLC separations, there needs to be a focus upon developing higher resolution separation methodologies and technologies that can be combined with both MS and 2D NMR. The development of 2D LC separations, as well as time-series retention index standards that are applicable to LC, as n-alkanes and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) are applied in GC, would provide a massive step change towards developing retention time (RT)-MS\/MS and MS n libraries that are transferable between different LC-MS systems and laboratories. Overcoming such hurdles and enhancing our metabolite annotation capabilities will be particularly valuable to the discovery of antimicrobial and viral molecules in plant-pathogen research. A recent study reports the metabolic setting of plant-virus interactions in a natural habitat and its predictive link to susceptibility, unravelling new insight into plant-virus interactions and providing attractive antimicrobial targets [163]. Likewise, machine learning-based predictive metabolomics is particularly promising, to reveal and validate metabolic predictors under biotic stress [164]. Future bioinformatics developments for metabolomics will reduce human intervention and increase **data** analysis throughput, thanks to robotized assays, for instance [157,164]."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.834653Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:57:18.435538Z","inner_id":154,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":155,"annotations":[{"id":154,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"0SxlWCHboe","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:57:22.541125Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:57:22.541158Z","lead_time":3.917,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":155,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":53478339,"section":"16\/24","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.667,"text":"Assuming that the δ 18 O-Sr\/Ca vital effect relationship remained constant between mid-Holocene and modern day corals, δ 18 O sw **data** provide a robust method to assess hydrological differences between different epochs.

Our **data** imply that the promiscuity of 4CL5 allows the catalytic conversion of a great diversity of dihydrocinnamates, benzoates, and various cinnamates into the corresponding acyl-CoA-thioesters. To our doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0138972.g004 Table 3. Structural characteristics of the benzoyl anthranilates (general structure shown in Fig 1C) Table 3.  Our original attempts to co-express HCBT with known bacterial benzoyl:CoA ligases for the production of benzoyl anthranilates in yeast were unsuccessful, possibly due to the high pH optima (pH > 8.5) of these enzymes [36,37]. Nevertheless, using the 4CL5 enzyme, we demonstrate the feasibility of producing a substantial diversity of benzoyl-CoA thioesters and benzoate conjugate molecules in yeast. This discovery opens new possibilities for the heterologous combinatorial production of valuable benzoylated metabolites such as benzylbenzoates; benzophenones; the anticancer drug taxol; polyketides with antimicrobial activities (e.g., wailupemycin, enterocin, soraphen A); and unnatural polyketides using engineered benzoyl-CoAdependent polyketide synthases [38]. Furthermore, heterologously synthesized benzoyl anthranilates can be used as scaffolds for the synthesis of related anti-adenoviral compounds and oncogene inhibitors [39,40]. We observed the activity of 4CL5 towards various dihydrocinnamates and non-natural halogenated cinnamates and exploited its catalytic property to biosynthesize libraries of nonnatural and structurally diverse cinnamoyl and dihydrocinnamoyl anthranilates using HCBT. For example, the drug DHavnD was synthesized, and utilization of alternate precursors resulted in the rapid production of 27 additional DHavnD analogs. These results point towards the eventual design of more biologically active drugs through the addition of halogens. They also illustrate the advantage of biological synthesis to achieve bifunctionalization, as exemplified by several of our bi-halogenated compounds. Finally, through co-expression with the adequate synthases, the capacity of 4CL5 to activate dihydrocinnamates creates the potential for biomanufacture of valuable natural products, such as the antibacterial dihydrocinnamoyl forms of flavans and chalcones [41,42]."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.835499Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:58:38.478434Z","inner_id":161,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":162,"annotations":[{"id":161,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"XtB8kBL2ke","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:58:44.402759Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:58:44.402795Z","lead_time":5.733,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":162,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":237305738,"section":"13\/19","subsection":3.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.684,"text":"To echo this last point, one of the main challenges of metabolomics in plant pathology is distinguishing plant and microbial metabolomes [80]. Metabolites, most particularly primary compounds, are often ubiquitous in the diverse plant, microbial and animal organisms, or exchanged between the host and pathogens, as signals or metabolic responses. In pathological studies (Figure 1), plants and microbes are jointly incubated, but the pathogens are rarely removed before metabolite extraction, thereby mixing metabolomes of different origins. This probably seems to be of minor importance for other omics, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, which exploit species-specific databases. However, metabolomics suffers from cross-contamination of the host and non-host metabolites; therefore, it is often difficult to draw precise conclusions as to the origin of the metabolic variations found. Whilst one can search **data** for metabolites of non-plant origin, for example, arachidonic acid with respect to fungal pathogens, one cannot assume that their absence suggests that metabolites of fungal origin are not being detected. Implementing stable isotope labelling of microbes could address this pressing concern. A recent metabolomics study of the early stage of plant cell-microbe interactions employed an incubation method of 13 C-and 15 N-labelled (98%) Pst DC3000 with Arabidopsis cells, followed by a washing step to remove the excess bacterial cells [169]. Subsequently, \"light\" plant metabolites were analyzed by targeted LC-MS, highlighting an infection reprogramming of plant signaling and primary metabolic pathways, including carbohydrates, nucleotides, and amino and organic acids. Alternatively, uniformly 13 C-and 15 N-labelled plants can be prepared, which will offer an accurate tool for metabolomic analysis under biotic stress conditions [170]. The growing interest in isotopically labelled biological material coincides with the development of additional analytical tools, such as NMR and high-throughput GC-and LC-HRMS, which allow the discrimination between native and labelled metabolites ( Figure 3). It is conceivable that elegant studies of this type will be carried out less sporadically, to help clarify the origin of changes in the host and pathogen metabolome. In summary, future prospects that will greatly contribute to the success of metabolomics in the study of plant immunity will include (i) increasing the capacity to chromatopgraphically resolve and annotate plant and pathogen metabolomes, (ii) new tools and approaches to analyze the metabolome at the subcellular level, and (iii) the development and implementation of modelling, to predict and\/or calculate the dynamics of metabolic variations."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.836129Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:58:44.440133Z","inner_id":162,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":163,"annotations":[{"id":162,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"WphG-nAPfX","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T17:58:51.272237Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:58:51.272268Z","lead_time":6.318,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":163,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":3789137,"section":"19\/23","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.826,"text":"Although previous works showed that SYK accumulated in the cytoplasm in RB cells (Zhang et al. 2012), our immunofluorescent staining results showed SYK expression on the cell surface. SYK protein localization on the cell membrane facilitates activated CTLs to specifically recognize the antigens present on the surface of RB-Y79 cells. This is key for specific lymphocyte-based immunotherapy. SYK is also a member of a family of cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This confers an additional advantage for its use in targeted cell immunotherapy because RB-Y79 cells express the SYK protein on the cell surface, allowing it to be recognized by cytotoxic immune cells, while hematopoietic cells, which express cytoplasmic SYK, may be protected from SYK-driven immune cytotoxic activity (Chauhan et al. 2016). Although we demonstrated SYK gene expression in SYK-DCs by qRT-PCR, we failed to detect SYK protein on the surface of infected DC cells using flow cytometry (data not shown). The possible reasons why we failed to detect the SYK signal in DCs could due to two aspects. Firstly, in a classical pathway in DCs, the antigen is cleaved into peptides by endosomal proteases, particularly cathepsin S, and bound by class I molecules probably in the endocytic compartment itself (Rock and Shen 2005). Secondly, the processed antigen could not be presented everlastingly on the DC surface, published **data** have also explained how duration of antigen presentation affects the dynamics of T-cell-DC interactions and consequently determine immune response (Benson et al. 2015).

For unchanged non-forest, pixels classified as water, snow\/ ice, or wetland were excluded using the major composite of MODIS land cover from 2002 to 2005 with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification scheme. For \"changed\" forest pixels, forest loss was identified as those with a net forest loss >0.15. Forest loss defined this way is expected to pose a stronger signal on clouds than that with a lower threshold, and thus improves the detectability of cloud impact against natural variability of cloud cover."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.837468Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:00:34.888462Z","inner_id":169,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":170,"annotations":[{"id":169,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["maybe"]},"id":"at5uLWkrhj","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:00:43.664730Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:00:43.664785Z","lead_time":8.588,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":170,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":8604607,"section":"13\/30","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.433,"text":"The funders had no role in study design, **data** collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

In order to explore this, we decided to further characterize K18 PFFs uptake and internalization following PIKfyve inhibition. Using K18 PFFs labeled with the pH-insensitive AF488, the number of K18 or FL Tau PFF-positive vesicles in primary hippocampal neurons was to our surprise not altered at 100 nM or 1 μM YM-201636 treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). These results seemed at first to be counterintuitive given our previous **data** using pHrodo labeled K18 PFFs that suggested reduced internalization. To address this conundrum, we tested if pharmacological inhibition of PIKfyve would reduce K18-pHrodo signal as we observed using the knockdown approach. Similar to PIKfyve knock-down, treatment of primary hippocampal neurons with YM-201636 displayed a dose-dependent reduction in K18-pHrodo signal (Fig. 5, C and D). Since the pHrodo signal is not only dependent on neuronal internalization of a labeled substrate but also on the transport into low-pH compartments, we evaluated intracellular acidification using LysoTracker. Interestingly, YM-201636 treatment did not show a decrease, but rather an increase in LysoTracker intensity at concentrations up to 1 μM before reducing due to toxicity (Fig. 5F). These **data** show that the reduction in K18-pHrodo signal is not due to impaired acidification but instead suggest that K18 PFFs are retained in nonacidic vesicles in the endosomal pathway. In support of this notion, PIKfyve inhibition has been linked to an intracellular vesicular phenotype consisting in enlarged endosomes, caused by the reduced maturation of MVB into lysosomes as well as lysosomal recycling (52,53). Indeed, when we treated primary hippocampal neurons with 1 μM YM-201636, we noticed a decrease in the number of LAMP1-positive organelles but an increase in their size, supported by 3D imaging and in line with previous reports (54, 55) (Figs. 5E and S8). Similar findings can be observed in HEK293T cells following 30 min treatment with 1 μM YM-201636, pointing to a cell-typeindependent phenotype (Fig. S9). These **data** suggest that the reduction in K18 PFFs internalization previously seen with Rac1 inhibition is carried out by a mechanism that is PIKfyveindependent, while PIKfyve could be important for the fate of the seed once internalized."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.838142Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:01:09.246834Z","inner_id":174,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":175,"annotations":[{"id":174,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"cLcC_tpfB5","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:01:12.558787Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:01:12.558819Z","lead_time":3.125,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":175,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":203926270,"section":"16\/22","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.727,"text":"To confirm the results, 740Y-P (a PI3K agonist, Selleck, USA, S7865) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor, Selleck, USA, S1105) were used to treat MNNG cells alone or combined with C 18 H 17 NO 6 for 48 h.

Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021).

Second, while we included a measure of perceived health, which has been shown to attenuate the association between happiness and all-cause mortality (Liu et al., 2016), we did not examine a variety of specific psychological (e.g. personality, coping style), health (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine, exercise) and social factors (e.g. social stress and support, income) that may be associated with positive affect (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005).

The cloud effects of forests estimated in a recent study 58 based on a different MODIS-derived cloud dataset 59 (produced by a different retrieval algorithm) revealed a similar global dominance of cloud enhancement and regional prevalence of cloud inhibition (e.g., in Amazon). Yet regional inconsistencies remained for Southeast US and Central Africa, where the identified cloud inhibition could be weakened or absent with alternative cloud **data** (ref. 58 and Supplementary Fig. 13). This emphasizes the need of using multi-source cloud **data** to improve the robustness of the estimated cloud effects while reducing the uncertainty from data. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cloud inhibition in these regions is indirectly supported by lower sensible heat over forests, which is in line with the mesoscale circulation mechanism, as well as the consistency between potential cloud inhibition and the actual cloud increase over forest loss locations (i.e., Southeast US hotspot). While more direct observational evidence is always desirable to help resolve inconsistencies, the lack of observations in regions like Central Africa, which have received less attention than the Amazon, hinders comparisons against other available evidence.

WELCOA has written a report that identifies how the unhealthy lifestyles of employees, combined with increasing healthcare costs, have impacted the bottom line of most American businesses. [5] Most **data** have shown ROI savings in healthcare costs because of WHPPs, ranging from $1.40 to $3.14\/dollar spent, with a mean of around $3.00. [18,44] One paper reviewed 32 studies in 2001, showing an ROI of $3.48. [45] In a meta-analysis of 56 studies on the economic impact of WHPPs, 28 focused on healthcare costs, making it the most prevalent concern for businesses and the most common rationale for providing WHPPs. [46] Looking at frequency and cost of prescription drugs and medical claims, another study found, after 5 years, a cost savings of $3.85 for every dollar spent on the program. [12] A decrease in sick leave is the second-most prevalent economic variable and concern to employers when measuring the value of WHPPs. [46] In a study that reviewed 14 articles that assessed WHPPs, a reduction in employee absenteeism was found in each article. [45] A meta-analysis of 62 studies found that WHPPs represent very effective approach for reducing medical costs and absenteeism. [47] Studies involving WHPP ROI assessment should be sure to minimize any bias; use projected, not actual savings; accurately measure productivity savings; include significant factors; assess representative study groups; and include all expenses. [48] WHPP ROI assessment in college settings is lacking.

However, this study has three main limitations. The first limitation is the assumptions. For example, the production of mortar waste recycling is not ignored, thereby affecting the accuracy of the results. The second limitation is that only the construction waste generated from new construction activities are quantified in this research. If other types of waste, such as demolition waste, construction clay and mud, are considered, then the carbon emission will be higher. The third one is that this study does not compare the outcomes with other disposals, such as traditional landfill practice. If such comparisons can be done, then it could provide decision makers with a clearer understanding of the carbon-saving potential generated from recycling construction waste. Despite research limitations, the results can still provide regulatory authorities with theoretical methods and **data** to establish strategies and policies on promoting waste recycling and cutting down on CO 2 emissions.

We find that with reduced resolutions of cloud data, the spatial coverage of cloud inhibition shrinks from~37% at 0.05°to~24-28% at 1°, while cloud enhancement becomes more dominant (from 63% to~76-72%) (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 2). This implies that at coarser scales (e.g., typical GCM spatial resolutions), at which mesoscale processes become less important (i.e., less cloud inhibition), observation-and model-based results tend to converge on cloud enhancement of forests."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.845425Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:06:20.270995Z","inner_id":205,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":206,"annotations":[{"id":205,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"SazfmFDAgJ","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:06:28.537181Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:06:28.537213Z","lead_time":8.106,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":206,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":248757902,"section":"6\/11","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.545,"text":"DNA methylation is specific, particularly in gene promoter regions, and can be used as cancer marker (15).

Ultimately, 8 genes were identified as co-morbid genes for T2DM and cancer. Since the information of different diseases is integrated in our network, the types of cancer involved in comorbid genes and their frequencies, as well as the connectivity values of gene nodes, all reflect the close relationship between T2DM and cancer. The results showed that among these 8 genes, the frequency of CRC was the highest (5\/8).

With respect to K18 PFFs uptake and tau aggregation, actin polymerization inhibition clearly resulted in a significant reduction of internalized K18 PFFs (IC 50 = 57 nM) and consequently decreased significantly K18 PFFs-seeded tau aggregation (IC 50 = 25 nM) (Fig. 1, G and H).

Our findings are consistent with previous research on quality indicator implementation in various care settings and studies on the implementation of PREMs and PROMs. 10-12 32-34 Challenges associated with knowledge, skills (need for training), time constraints and motivation around measurement have been widely reported.

One important aspect and strength of digital biomarkers in general, and ki:e SB-C in particular, is automation. Speech **data** can be easily collected by telephone or by mobile front-ends face-to-face, and ki:e SB-C can be reliably calculated using the proprietary automatic speech analysis pipeline. Verification step of this study revealed that the automatic speech processing pipeline, including speech recognition, performs at an acceptable level across different languages and tasks, and therefore, automatic processing works reliably for the purposes of  the biomarker. The aim of the analytical validation was threefold: to evaluate (1) the ki:e SB-C against a cognitive gold standard measure (MMSE), (2) the biomarker's retest reliability, and (3) how well ki:e SB-C reflects agerelated -but clinically not relevant -changes. The results of the analytical validation analyses revealed that ki:e SB-C was a valid biomarker to measure cognitive abilities that are relevant for the target population, as seen by its high correlation with MMSE scores even if corrected for the effect of age. Furthermore, the automatically calculated biomarker was stable in retesting as assessed by a test-retest analysis. It is well established that aging is a risk factor for cognitive decline and diseases [26]; however, not all changes are pathological. It is important for a biomarker that is a surrogate for cognition to reflect subtle changes that are at a subclinical level. Our results showed that ki:e SB-C can detect age-related changes in cognitive function. These changes are also reflected in MMSE scores as a trend. Regarding the direct comparison with the MMSE on the healthy DeepSpA population, the SB-C seems to vary more marked by a larger standard deviation (regarding the mean) as compared to the MMSE. This might be also due to the fact that the SB-C is a more fine-grained measure as compared to the MMSE, which might especially in the healthy population lack the resolution to measure cognitive changes at this higher functioning level and would elicit less variance."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.846257Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:07:59.131346Z","inner_id":216,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":217,"annotations":[{"id":216,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["data availability statement"]},"id":"gBNgzpsaO8","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:08.125072Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:08.125111Z","lead_time":8.805,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":217,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":237856376,"section":"3\/27","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.111,"text":"Since the authors have proposed and verified that human capital accumulation promoted GTP [8] and pointed out in the introduction that the CW-regions had comparative advantages in human capital, this paper further proposes proposition 1: the comparative advantage of human capital in the CW-regions of China has prompted these regions to choose GTP more.

In contrast, regulation of yeast GCN4 translation by nutrient levels was independent of the peptide sequences encoded by its uORFs (49,50). Our current study showed that introduction of stop codon constructs (þS), thereby changing the sequence of peptide encoded by the uORF, exhibited changes similar to those seen in the translation of the downstream cistron ( Figure 5B). Furthermore, mutating the uAUGs while also introducing the stop codon (M þ S) caused a marked increase in the translation of the downstream cistron ( Figure 5D). These **data** show that regulation of the MOR uORF is independent of the peptide sequence of the uORF. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the uORF during MOR translation is a protein-independent mechanism. Although the mechanisms involved in explaining the inhibitory effects of the uORF peptide on translation are not understood, several models could be proposed. For example, the peptide of the uORF could be synthesized and have the ability to inhibit translation only at high concentrations in the local microenvironment (51)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.846548Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:30.473846Z","inner_id":220,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":221,"annotations":[{"id":220,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"eXVOrwoNp1","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:37.432548Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:37.432585Z","lead_time":6.78,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":221,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":24097617,"section":"9\/11","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.818,"text":"FIGURE 3 .\n3Monitoring circadian rhythms in the Kai protein oscillatory solution using FCS.

The motif ''regulator chain'' is only enriched in phosphorylation network. Based on the linear regulatory model ( Figure 1C), it can be inferred that KPFN is more predictive of co-function than KBN, which coincides with our observation. The ''bi-input'' motif is also enriched in phosphorylation network, resulting in a genetic buffering effect of phosphorylation events [4]. In transcriptional regulatory networks ''feed forward loop'' (FFL) motif was enriched, which have already been widely discussed [2] [15] [16]. The motifs with loop structure within regulators (bicomponent loop1, bi-component loop2) are also enriched in transcriptional regulatory networks. In these motifs, two TFs transcribe each other, and generate a bi-stable system, which switches between two alternative states [17] [2]. The two motifs tend to characterize an important mode in transcriptional regulation. TFs cooperate to regulate a set of genes (bi-component loop 2), but their functions are not completely redundant (bicomponent loop 1). For example, Ste12 and Tec1 are two TFs that co-regulate genes in filamentous pathway (for example, Kss1), but only Ste12 activates genes in mating pheromone pathway (for example, Ste3) ( Figure 2). In this case, the resultant signatures are divergent but their binding profiles overlap with each other on the co-regulated genes ( Figure S1). This phenomenon is termed mixed epistasis in phosphorylation network [4], where two kinase partly buffer each other, and also have unique functions themselves. We demonstrate that this definition can also be extended to transcriptional network according to the enriched bi-component loops. Because of the enriched buffering relationships in transcriptional regulatory networks, TFBN is more predictive of co-function than TFFN, which is also consistent with our observation. In the combined network, the enriched motif is FFL, which couples phosphorylation with transcription. A previous study showed that FFL formed by kinase CDK1 and transcriptional factors was important to drive temporal transcriptional responses in cell cycle regulation [11]."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.846708Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:45.442683Z","inner_id":222,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":223,"annotations":[{"id":222,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"ly1sVXeXAH","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:55.071495Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:08:55.071537Z","lead_time":9.448,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":223,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":249932676,"section":"23\/33","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.697,"text":"There are several limitations worth noting.

A posterior to anterior gradient of cell motility of ingressed mesodermal cells has been documented along the regressing PS (Zamir et al., 2006). These graded movements in the mesoderm are largely controled by a posterior to anterior gradient of Fgf8 established in the PS and acting as a repellent on newly ingressed mesodermal cells at this stage (Yang et al., 2002). This cellular dynamics suggests that the movement away from the posterior PS could act as a sink for the epiblastic territories generating these progenitors. These cell movements in the epiblast and the ingressing mesoderm could explain the progressive exhaustion of the PS from its posterior end first described for the extraembryonic territory (Spratt Jr., 1947). Importantly, our **data** show that the precursor territories along the PS do not disappear at the same rate. We observe a sequential posterior to anterior exhaustion of the territories of the extraembryonic mesoderm, the lateral plate and the SOX2 negative paraxial mesoderm progenitors (Figure 3k). Combined to an increased proliferation in the NMP region, this would explain why the SOX2\/T territory eventually remains as the major remnant of the PS in the tail bud after PS regression. Thus, the tail bud is composed of a mosaic of monopotent territories such as the precursors of the notochord, or the hindgut, and the multipotent NMPs, which give rise to descendants in the ectoderm and mesoderm. This likely explains why the tail bud appears as a site where gastrulation movements are still ongoing but also shows blastema characteristics (Catala et al., 1995;Davis and Kirschner, 2000;Gont et al., 1993;Holmdahl, 1925)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.846995Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:09:47.465631Z","inner_id":226,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":227,"annotations":[{"id":226,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["data availability statement"]},"id":"2iyg4nvVfq","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:09:51.914982Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:09:51.915022Z","lead_time":4.262,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":227,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":251482760,"section":"38\/43","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.884,"text":"Author\nContributions: Conceptualization, R.B.O., G.Z., K.I.S. and D.M.; methodology, G.Z., D.Z.-D. and R.G.; software, K.I.S. and A.I.U.; validation, G.Z., U.Ç., A.K. and S.D.; formal analysis, G.Z.; investigation, R.B.O., G.Z., K.I.S., D.M., D.Z.-D. and R.G.; resources, U.Ç.; **data** curation, R.B.O., G.Z. and S.D.; writing-original draft preparation, R.B.O., G.Z., K.I.S., D.M., D.Z.-D., R.G., S.J. and M.F.M.; writing-review and editing, G.Z., S.D. and M.F.M.; visualization, A.K.; supervision, G.Z.; project administration, G.Z.; funding acquisition, D.M.

Moreover, patients with a higher level of betatrophin significantly correlated with a higher risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [38] and enhanced ER stress in hepatocyte [39]. Also, the higher expression of betatrophin was reported in patients with liver cirrhosis and has a significant association with the degree of liver fibrosis [40]. Our study was broadly consistent with previous findings that show the fundamental role of betatrophin in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis related to fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. Thus, the alteration of liver and circulating betatrophin levels may enhance the early stage of hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the preliminary data, here the limitation of our study is that no clear information whether the alteration of betatrophin expression has a direct association with the silencing of miR-122 and early symptom of HCC. Furthermore, we cannot provide a comprehensive **data** the correlation of betatrophin with tumor growth factor that involved in liver fibrosis-HCC development.

Invariably, an interplay of multiple factors concurrently contributes to the development of encephalopathy. As a result, predicting the short-and long-term consequences of impaired consciousness and cognition remains a challenge, in which the self-fulfilling prophecy bias of premature pessimistic outcome predictions plays an important role [75,76]. Key disease-specific knowledge gaps in neuroprognostication have been recently unveiled in a joint statement from the German Neurocritical Care Society and the Neurocritical Care Society [77]; future studies should account for these limitations. Population-derived disease severity scores are incorrectly used to ascertain long-term individual prognostic trajectories. Further, these scores are not dynamic and are frequently inaccurate. Accurate neuroprognostication is crucial to guide critical care resource allocation and to guide families in goals of care discussions; thus, it is imperative to improve tools for prognostication in neurocritically ill patients. cEEG monitoring provides dynamic information on brain physiology, and it can be used as a noninvasive biomarker that correlates with level of consciousness [78] and neurological recovery [79].

PI 4,5 P 2 modulates the initial steps of endocytosis through different mechanisms, including the modulation of actin polymerization by sequestering of actin binders (46); recruitment of proteins that mediate membrane curvature (e.g., BIN1) (47), and interaction with specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), glycancoated proteins that are reported to interact with K18 PFFs (17). On the other hand, PI 3,5 P 2 regulates endosomal vesicle maturation, in particular the maturing steps between the multivesicular body (MVB), late endosomes and lysosomes, including associated recycling events (48). We decided to target the different subfamilies of PIP5K using LV-shRNAs and test how these affect the process of K18 PFFs internalization using live-cell imaging. After imaging, samples were lysed and effective knockdown was confirmed through RT-qPCR. We tested the efficacy of three distinct LV-shRNAs in knocking down Pikfyve.

Furthermore, none of the control LV-shRNA used could affect Pikfyve mRNA expression of K18-pHrodo signal. These **data** suggest that PIKfyve function may be an important regulator in K18 PFFs internalization. Data on the effect of other PIP5K family knockdown can be consulted in Figure S5.

Mutism has been frequently observed in cases of insular pathology: Transient mutism is found in cases of left inferior motor cortex damage extending to the insula [57,58], whereas lasting mutism appears to be associated with bilateral lesions of the frontal operculum and anterior insula [59][60][61]. Functional magnetic resonance studies have revealed significant blood flow increases at the level of intrasylvian cortex during overt speech in the left anterior insula [62,63], suggesting that the left insula plays a role in the coordination of speech articulation.

The present narrative mini-review was aimed at investigating the role of psychiatric comorbidity in explaining potential different responses to baclofen treatment among AUD patients. The results show that the majority of AUD patients treated with baclofen and described by the case reports, as well as the observational and retrospective studies, suffered from anxiety and\/or mood disorders. This finding agrees with **data** of large epidemiological studies (14,60). However, the results of the present review also show that, despite these disorders being common among AUD patients, patients with severe mental disorders (including severe anxiety and mood disorders) were excluded by the randomized, controlled, trials (RCTs) conducted to evaluate the efficacy of baclofen to treat AUD. Therefore, these results do not allow us o evaluate whether baclofen efficacy is different in AUD patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders compared to those without. One RCT found that baclofen administration reduced alcohol consumption in anxious patients, but not in patients with low levels of anxiety (55). However, in this study, baclofen administration did not significantly reduce anxiety levels. A recent meta-analysis also found no difference between baclofen and placebo in reducing both depression and anxiety levels among AUD patients (64). The results of the present review may be useful to better understand these results. Indeed, both these studies (55,64) evaluated the efficacy of baclofen in modifying the severity of anxiety or depression among AUD patients not affected by severe mental disorders. In addition, the RCTs used different scales to measure the severity of anxiety and\/or depression, such as self-reported rating scales (e.g., STAI, BDI, and ZUNG) and interviewer-rated scales (e.g., HAM-A, HAM-D, and MADRS). The exclusion of patients with severe mental disorders, and the variability in the scales adopted, prevents current meta-analyses to evaluate potential differences in baclofen efficacy in reducing the severity of the comorbid mental disorders. To reduce the variability, the interviewer-rated scales should be used rather than self-reported rating scales (65,66). Accordingly, it is desirable that future RCTs investigate the efficacy of baclofen in AUD patients affected by other mental disorders, using interviewer-rated scales to establish the effects on the severity of anxiety and\/or depression."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.852219Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:14:05.200715Z","inner_id":255,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":256,"annotations":[{"id":255,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["data availability statement"]},"id":"C1CZjpIV3_","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:14:08.111985Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:14:08.112021Z","lead_time":2.716,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":256,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":249932676,"section":"27\/33","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.818,"text":"YY contributed to the conception, **data** curation, formal analysis, and manuscript writing and editing.

In addition, there is increasing evidence showing that these PRRs also sense endogenous danger signals, known as DAMPs that are released by necrotic cells. 107 The PRR group consists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and C-type lectin receptors. Depending on the cellular context, PRR triggering can induce different types of cell death. To date, TLR-mediated necrotic cell death has been described in cells triggered by TLR3, -4 and -9. Recognition of dsRNA or poly(I:C) (synthetic dsRNA analog) by TLR3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4 triggers the recruitment of an adaptor called Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-b, 108,109 which interacts with both RIPK1 and RIPK3 via its RHIM domain, 110 suggesting the possible involvement of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in TLR3-and TLR4-induced necrosis. Indeed, poly(I:C)-induced necroptotic cell death in the presence of interferon-b is inhibited in RIPK1-deficient cells 111 or when RIPK1 kinase activity is blocked. 24,34 Recently, it has been reported that poly(I:C) stimulation in a steatohepatitis disease model induces necrosis that is correlated with an increase in RIPK3 expression, indicating a possible role for RIPK3 in poly(I:C)induced regulated necrosis in vivo. 112 Triggering TLR4 by LPS prevents necrotic cell death of macrophages when either RIPK1 or RIPK3 is absent by RNA interference-mediated knockdown. 18,113 Together, these **data** suggest that TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation may induce RIPK1-and RIPK3dependent necroptosis (Figure 2b)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.852507Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:14:21.952250Z","inner_id":259,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":260,"annotations":[{"id":259,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"QWOV7l-muI","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:14:24.404110Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:14:24.404156Z","lead_time":2.254,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":260,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":80580980,"section":"9\/27","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.333,"text":"PEDF is localized in human testicular biopsy tissue, particularly the extracellular matrix and the cells of the tubular wall [48].

A key ingredient in an event study involves the date(s). Regarding the emergence of COVID-19, we make use of the official date of the declaration of the disease as a global pandemic by the WHO, i.e., March 11, 2020. Other studies look at the impact of other important different dates related to COVID-19 (e.g., Ashraf, 2020a, Ashraf, 2020bHeyden and Heyden, 2021), such as: (i) the date of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the country; or (ii) the date of the first COVID-19 death in the country. Regarding key **data** on COVID-19 vaccines, we use a single date for each vaccine: when the vaccine effectiveness was announced as against the dates of vaccine trials. This choice is justified by the fact that vaccine development is a lengthy and uncertain process that generally takes around 10-15 years to complete before the vaccine can be mass-produced for public use (e.g., Chan et al., 2021). Despite the fact that the start of each phase marks a milestone in vaccine development because it (i) indicates the successful completion of the previous phase and (ii) boosts people's belief that the vaccine has a higher likelihood of progressing to the next stage, industry statistics show that only one-sixth of all vaccine candidates that undergo human clinical trials obtain final approval for mass production (Chan et al., 2021). Therefore, a more significant impact is to be expected when the vaccine is accepted by the regulators for mass population vaccination. We are aware that the magnitude of the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness announcements was influenced by the chosen dates."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.852802Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:29:10.611744Z","inner_id":263,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":264,"annotations":[{"id":262,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"SFRhmMpLb8","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:15:03.477881Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:15:03.477944Z","lead_time":12.099,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":264,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":25826755,"section":"8\/22","subsection":3.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.364,"text":"We and others have shown in smooth muscle cells that depletion of cholesterol or silencing of caveolin-1 expression disrupts the organization of membrane caveolae and alters functional responses, as measured by contractile agonist-induced intracellular Ca 2+ release and force generation (Gosens et al., 2007b;Prakash et al., 2007). Our new **data** are consistent with these observations and those showing a role for the actin cytoskeleton in modulating Ca 2+ responses in several other cell types (Calaghan et al., 2004;Rosado et al., 2000;Sabala et al., 2002), because induced changes in ultrastructure and the protein profile of caveolae were associated with a reduction both sensitivity to MCh and in maximum peak [Ca 2+ ] i . Trimeric G-proteins are sequestered to caveolae through the interaction of -subunits with caveolin-1, and the signaling machinery required to mobilize Ca 2+ within smooth muscle cells is organized in caveolae (Darby et al., 2000;de Weerd and Leeb-Lundberg, 1997;Gosens et al., 2007b;Kifor et al., 1998;Li et al., 1995). Although PLC1 is concentrated at the cell membrane, it is also present throughout the cell, whereas G q is more-or-less membrane specific, where it stably associates with PLC1 to allow for rapid transmission of intracellular signals via GPCRs such as the M3 muscarinic receptor (Dowal et al., 2006). Recent evidence suggests that caveolin-1 can have a regulatory role, promoting dissociation of G subunits from  subunits to facilitate GPCR signal transduction (Sengupta et al., 2008). Interaction between caveolin-1 and -dystroglycan appears to be necessary for such a functional role, because in human airway smooth muscle cells with stably silenced -dystroglycan, PLC1 and G q were lost from caveolae and accumulated in fractions that are typically devoid of caveolae. As this change mirrored that for PTRF\/cavin and caveolin-1, it suggests that interaction of caveolae with structural proteins and the actin cytoskeleton supports sequestration of signaling molecules for Ca 2+ mobilization, and enable a regulator role for caveolin-1."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.852882Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:15:03.520536Z","inner_id":264,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":265,"annotations":[{"id":263,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"2hNKb5mfxN","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:15:07.486414Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:15:07.486450Z","lead_time":3.778,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":265,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":220474872,"section":"27\/49","subsection":3.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.551,"text":"The potential of combining checkpoint inhibitors with OV therapy is currently being tested in a phase II clinical study (NCT02798406) where the adenovirus DNX-2401 with pembrolizumab are used in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) and gliosarcoma.

In CFA rats, the siRNAmediated knockdown of NOV led to a specific upregulation of MMP-9 in the DRG and MMP-2 in the DHSC (and CCL2 in the DRG, **data** not shown), consistent with our in vitro data. Remarkably, endogenously produced NOV depletion resulted in increased tactile hypersensitivity. The compatible pattern of MMP-2\/-9 and NOV expression at the late phase of inflammatory pain further raises the possibility that NOV reduction could specifically lead to transient MMP-9 induction in the DRG and a persistent increase of MMP-2 expression in the spinal cord, thereby contributing to the maintenance of pain. Admittedly, NOV is likely to act in concert with other specific partners of a given neuroinflammatory environment to modulate MMP-2\/-9 expression. This is supported by our **data** showing NOV modulation of cytokine activities in vitro and cytokines induction at a late phase of inflammatory pain. In addition, NOV reduction at a late phase of the development of inflammatory pain contrasts with the early development of pain hypersensitivity indicating that NOV might not be involved in the early stage of pain induction but be required at a later precise time slot during pain pathogenesis. Even though the NOV-null mouse has been generated recently, its nervous system phenotype has not yet been reported. The NOV-null mouse shows normal development but enhanced neointimal hyperplasia in response to endothelial injury [48].

The goals of the present study were to determine the activation signal(s) for rprY and clarify its role in the oxidative stress response. We found that the regulator was essential for growth of P. gingivalis under sodiumlimited growth conditions. While the parent strain adapted and was able to grow, albeit slowly, under these conditions, an rprY mutant strain could not, indicating that RprY was essential for the response to this stress and hence viability. By transcription profiling and metabolite analyses we determined that sodium limitation induced an oxidative stress response in both parent and rprY mutants strains. However, the response was highly amplified in the mutant and was accompanied by dysregulation of genes encoding protein chaperones. We found that RprY interacted directly with the promoters of several chaperone genes, and collectively our **data** indicate that the regulator acts as a repressor of their expression.

Disruption of this linkage renders the sarcolemma susceptible to contractioninduced damage (Petrof et al., 1993). SSPN is absent from the sarcolemma of patients with sarcoglycan-deficient AR-LGMD, indicating that membrane targeting and stability of SSPN is dependent on the SGs (Crosbie et al., 1999). Sarcospan is not restored to the sarcolemma even in AR-LGMD cases with partial SG deficiency where three out of four The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex spans the muscle plasma membrane and provides a mechanical linkage between laminin in the extracellular matrix and actin in the intracellular cytoskeleton. Within the dystrophinglycoprotein complex, the sarcoglycans and sarcospan constitute a subcomplex of transmembrane proteins that stabilize ␣-dystroglycan, a receptor for laminin and other components of the extracellular matrix. In order to elucidate the function of sarcospan, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress sarcospan in skeletal muscle. Sarcospan transgenic mice with moderate (tenfold) levels of sarcospan overexpression exhibit a severe phenotype that is similar to mouse models of laminindeficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MD). Sarcospan transgenic mice display severe kyphosis and die prematurely between 6 and 10 weeks of age. Histological analysis reveals that sarcospan expression causes muscle pathology marked by increased muscle fiber degeneration and\/or regeneration. Sarcospan transgenic muscle does not display sarcolemma damage, which is distinct from dystrophin-and sarcoglycan-deficient muscular dystrophies. We show that sarcospan clusters the sarcoglycans into insoluble protein aggregates and causes destabilization of ␣-dystroglycan. Evidence is provided to demonstrate abnormal extracellular matrix assembly, which represents a probable pathological mechanism for the severe and lethal dystrophic phenotype.

PTH was chosen because it is a potent regulator of bone metabolism exerting a direct effect on osteoblastic behavior (42). In osteoblastic cells such as ROS, PTH, via binding to its receptor, activates multiple second messenger systems, including the cAMP-protein kinase A cascade (43). Indeed, we found that PTH stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentrationdependent manner in ROS, as has been previously demonstrated (39,41). However, in antisense transfectants RCx4 and RCx16, cells exhibiting decreased Cx43 and, consequently, decreased coupling, PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation was dramatically attenuated. Additionally, we found that subconfluent ROS and bG, cells that display decreased coupling, similarly demonstrated decreased cAMP responses to PTH. However, the cAMP response to PTH was greater in subconfluent ROS and bG than in antisense transfectants, probably because coupling was greater in subconfluent ROS and bG relative to antisense transfectants.

These results reveal the fact that, in the time course of CFA-induced pain, NOV levels are downregulated in the ipsilateral DRG and DHSC, suggesting a potential functional association between reduced NOV levels at a late phase and the establishment of prolonged pain."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.866323Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:20:03.466865Z","inner_id":299,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":300,"annotations":[{"id":298,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["data availability statement"]},"id":"ryNMcjyys3","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:20:08.437176Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:20:08.437210Z","lead_time":4.766,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":300,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":251711372,"section":"31\/119","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.261,"text":"We use the dates of the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic (March 11, 2020) and of the announcements of the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech (November 9, 2020), Moderna (November 16, 2020) and AstraZeneca (November 23, 2020) 1 vaccines in the US as event dates to compute abnormal returns (ARs).

Earlier reports suggest that the increase and decrease of pentobarbitone-induced sleep time can be a useful tool for examining the stimulatory or inhibitory effects on CNS, especially for investigating influences on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA A ) ergic systems in CNS. [24] The previous report suggested that ethanolic extract of Jatamansi significantly altered locomotor activity. [25] Jatamansone exerted a tranquilizing effect in mice and monkeys [13] and a significant reduction in hyperactivity and improvement in restlessness and aggressiveness on hyperkinetic children similar to amphetamine. [8] Alcoholic extract of Jatamansi root increased the level of GABA on acute administration and increased the levels of most of the central biogenic amines and inhibitory neurotransmitters on chronic administration. [27] Thus, earlier studies indicate isolated compounds or extracts exert highly significant sedative activity while **data** of this study indicates    Benzodiazepines have been used for the treatment of insomnia and other CNS disorders predominantly. These drugs potentiate the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter of GABA, by binding to a specific site on the GABA A receptors to produce allosteric enhancement of anion flux through this ligand-gated chloride channel. [28,29] Most sedative-hypnotics used in the treatment of insomnia target the GABA A receptor. As test drug increased the duration of sleep time induced by a sub hypnotic dose of pentobarbitone, it can be stated that the drug may interact with pentobarbitone on the CNS via GABA A -ergic mechanisms in CNS."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.866887Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:20:13.381107Z","inner_id":301,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":302,"annotations":[{"id":300,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"gVn8QYh_qT","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:20:22.083773Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:20:22.083834Z","lead_time":8.509,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":302,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":2111254,"section":"9\/20","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.45,"text":"Deciphering the signal transduction in normal cells and cancer cells is an essential step in curing cancer.

The core of the controversy centers around the question whether or not B. thuringiensis and its by-products are the main act or only have a support role-or, as Raymond et al. [23] have put it, whether B. thuringiensis is an 'impotent pathogen' or a full (killing) pathogen on its own right? With our studies, we cannot-and did not intend to-answer the question regarding the bacterial organism B. thuringiensis. However, we can answer the question regarding GM maize plants expressing solely more activated forms of the Cry toxin Cry1Ab. In our experiments, Cry toxins were the main act but with gut microbiota having a significant support role in conjunction with plant compounds. While the antibiotic treatment may have had an immune stimulating effect rendering the insects more tolerant to toxicemia, the lack of an effect in the survival or weight gain **data** of antibiotic treated larvae on control plants does not point to this effect.

The chemical classification should not be expected to be amenable to a more detailed level of interpretation, paralleling the outcome of the other p-XRF  investigation at San Vincenzo on soils from different excavated contexts (Di Renzoni, et al., 2016).

We suggest that p-XRF should not be habitually compared to ICP\/NAA and repeatedly be found wanting in its inability to cover all elements and \/or display equivalent levels of accuracy for all elements. At the same time p-XRF should not develop a 'scatter gun' reputation, generating one-off **data** which cannot be reused or can only be used for internalin-house -purposes. It is time to look boldly at its greatest attribute, that is, that of non-destructive, in situ, analysis aimed at analysing large quantities of sherds; equally important is our ability to formulate appropriate questions that it can answer, satisfactorily and conclusively. In the case of impasto ware there is already a good understanding of the origin and production of these wares; so the need now is to process large quantities of newly excavated material, and to assess whether they are imported or not. This study has shown that this type of assessment (local vs non local) is indeed feasible and effective. Coarse wares are amongst the most common fabrics found in many archaeological sites so the implication of the results of this study goes beyond the remit of our work on Stromboli.  \n"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.868182Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:21:45.159617Z","inner_id":312,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":313,"annotations":[{"id":311,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"D33QzxO4DI","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:21:49.246678Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:21:49.246743Z","lead_time":3.892,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":313,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":246493125,"section":"1\/5","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.2,"text":"Forests exhibit regionally varying effects on JJA cloud cover based on MODIS **data** (overpass at 13:30 local time, Fig. 1a).

Our **data** showed that several SA-related molecular components were responsive to Ti treatment in both shoot and roots. We found that several NBS-LRR receptors are upregulated in Ti-treated roots but only a few in shoots ( Figure 8A). PAD4, which is part of the SA regulatory module is upregulated in roots and lightly in shoots. The positive regulators of SA biosynthesis WRKY54, WRKY70, and CBP60g, are upregulated in roots, and WRKY54 only in shoots. The negative regulators of SA biosynthesis CAMTA2, CAMTA3, and CAMTA5 are also upregulated in roots with only CAMTA3 faintly upregulated in shoots. Interestingly no SA biosynthesis genes were found upregulated either in roots or shoots, suggesting that Ti might preactivate positive regulators of SA biosynthesis but at the same time negative regulators to prevent an undesirable high level of SA that could affect plant growth. NPR1 and NPR3, which regulate the SA response pathway are upregulated in roots but only NPR3 is upregulated in shoots. Downstream of SA perception by NPR1, pathogen-related genes, and WRKYs transcription factors are activated directly by TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6, which ultimately activate the global plant immune response known as SAR. TGA2 and TGA6 are upregulated in shoots while PR1 and WES1 are upregulated in the shoot. The cell death positive regulator SBB1 is upregulated in both roots and shoots whereas the mRNA exporter DRH1 which is needed to initiate cell death, is not.

The estimated USU contributions, when significant, need to be introduced as components of augmented covariance matrices associated with all the input experimental data. It has been shown by Capote and Neudecker [78] that when more than a one-dimensional quantity is to be evaluated (e.g., energy-dependent cross sections), the evaluated mean values, as well as the derived covariances, will be altered by the use of augmented covariance matrices that include the USU contributions. This is intuitively evident because a change in the inclusive **data** covariance matrix changes the effective weighings of the input **data** points and this will alter the evaluated mean values. Therefore, a-priori determined USU contribution (e.g., as done for a one-dimensional quantity 252 Cf(sf) ν tot , see Sect. V A below) cannot be added a-posteriori to evaluated uncertainties while keeping the originally evaluated mean values.

Note that some detoured prefixes were larger than \/24, so we traceroute multiple IPs within it as explained in Section 6.1. The validation methodology is stated in Algorithm 1. As previous work [22] has pointed out, we found many cases where AS path seen in control plane and AS path seen in **data** plane do not match. However, these paths can still show detour if the detour origin AS and the detour destination AS are still present in the traceroute observed AS path. We call such AS paths congruent. More specifically, we consider the detoured AS path congruent only if detour origin AS and detour return AS both are present in the traceroute-observed AS path in the same order (detour origin first). For example, if an AS path 'A B C D E' in control plane changed to 'A X B C E' in **data** plane where 'B' was detour origin and 'C' was detour destination, we consider it as a congruent path. To resolve traceroute path to AS path we used CAIDA ITDK and iPlane IP to AS mappings and in cases where no match was found we use longest prefix match on the global routing table for the hop IP. Then we map the longest prefix match to the AS that originated it. Out of all the IPs we saw in 163 traceroutes, only 44 could be mapped to an AS using the IP to AS datasets.

First, the child appears to parse the compound inappropriately, representing it as a single syllable. Second, it is orthographically plausible to represent the k sound with ck; however, in American English, ck can only occur after a short vowel; hence, this child's misspelling represents an implicit awareness of permissible orthotactic sequences, but not their constraints on word position.

We secondly propose to use an established serious game [9] to simulate not only fraudulent scenarios but also normal operation of a make-to-stock production company through user interaction in a real ERP system, generating both normal and fraudulent behavior simultaneously. Additionally, this allows us to extend the business processes investigated by previous **data** generators from the purchase-to-pay (P2P) process to modeling normal and fraudulent activity in the well established order-to-cash (O2C) process as well. Based on our extended requirements, we then design multiple fraud scenarios in cooperation with auditing experts. We conduct multiple runs of our proposed **data** generation scheme and produce ERP system **data** of multiple fiscal years of operation, extracting raw **data** from the ERP system. The resulting **data** contains many multi-relational tables that offer different views on the recorded company's business process. Since many fraud detection approaches require single tables to operate, we additionally create ready to use datasets from a subset of our multi-relational **data** that can be directly used for measuring and comparing the performance of fraud detection systems. We further extend these datasets by providing expert-created annotations for fraud cases that highlight the problematic entries of individual frauds for use in debugging and assessing performance of algorithms that focus on the detection of anomalous entries specifically."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T18:49:38.872013Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:26:23.455120Z","inner_id":348,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":349,"annotations":[{"id":347,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["not"]},"id":"MibPOtJVGW","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:26:33.756915Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T18:26:33.757244Z","lead_time":10.098,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":349,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"953ce747-data2lab_2023-02-18_AC.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":245986448,"section":"15\/45","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.333,"text":"One approach to reduce computational cost is through the use sparse GPs that approximate (between the gradient and function sampling), the gradient inputs may be sampled from an image in a grid format, however the addition of the function observations disrupts the required format to take advantage of Kronecker products directly, without any masking of regions.

All detected egg masses were removed 72 h after the release of the moths and taken to the laboratory, where the number of eggs and egg position on the plant (bottom, middle, and upper sector of the canopy) were evaluated.

The genomic sequences were compared against the database of strain 630 proteins by blastx, and a CDS feature in the query genome was created when a hit of over 90% identity was found. Glimmer3 was used to predict CDSs in genomic regions where no significant hits were found [50]. Any unique genomic regions left were examined and annotated manually in Artemis [51].
