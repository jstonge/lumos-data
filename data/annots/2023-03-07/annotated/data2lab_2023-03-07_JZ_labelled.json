It is important enough that several areas of research is devoted to various aspects of this problem. In the active learning paradigm, labels are acquired in an interactive fashion to maximize the benefit of each new label [Kapoor et al., 2007]. Related approaches include [Branson et al., 2011], where a 'human-in-the-loop' determines which labels to update, thus making the 'most' out of the acquired labels. Crowd sourcing through, e.g. Amazon mechanical turk (mTurk), allows for rapid collection of large amounts of labels, and much research is devoted to the efficient distribution of tasks and the interpretation and weighting of retrieved labels [Welinder et al., 2010]. Further areas include weakly supervised method, e.g. multiple instance learning [Dietterich et al., 1997] or latent structureal SVMs [Yu and Joachims, 2009] where the level of supervision is lower than the given task demands.

What has happened? To answer this one has to introduce notion of information: **data** considered contain only limited amount of information and all models possess it as well. They differ therefore in what concerns additional redundant information they posses, which reflects not so much the state of the measured object but rather the state of minds of scientists proposing these models.

The most common type of cross-dataset interlink on the SW are owl:sameAs links (Paris et al. 2019).

Accordingly, they proposed two implementations of the ADR. The simpler of the two, EXPLoRa-SF, was built to reduce network collisions by segregating end devices into channels based on their distance from the gateway. The second approach, EXPLoRa-AT, was built on the functionalities of EXPLoRa-SF and included an intelligence mechanism to equalize airtimes for all traffic in different transmission channels and to enforce channel usage fairness. Both algorithms were implemented and tested using LoRaSim and compared against the native ADR algorithm in terms of throughput and **data** extraction rate. The simulation environment was a network operating in the European ISM band consisting of 500 to 2000 end devices each transmitting a 160-byte packet every 5 to 3600 s.

Table 2 shows the cross-validation MSE of several MLP architectures, as measured on a fixed set of 10, 000 data-points separate from the 200, 000 samples used for training. Unsurprisingly, deeper networks seem to perform much better than shallower one (given a fixed amount of parameters). The accuracy of the network can be adjusted by adding (moderately wider) layers, at the cost of longer training and higher runtime latency. We emphasize the importance of the logarithmic feature transformation exposed in the previous subsection, without which our system would converge to much worse solutions -if at all.

We must now move from bona fide physical presence of boundaries to fiat, to address how we understand their presence interpretively. Analysing physical presence results in little more than dimensions: information about the geometry, topology, morphology, and topography of built space. The difficulty with such information is that it is entirely contingent whether it has any bearing on social understanding. 5 The evidence base of archaeology is distinctly material, which is arguably why the discipline has struggled to contribute more substantially to social theory and synthesis has traditionally shown little attention to material integration (Sherratt 1993;Vis 2009). What this foregrounds is that our precise understanding of empirically derived (mechanical objectivity) archaeological evidence as physical evidence (judgmental objectivity) (cf. Galison 1998Galison , 2000Galison , 2010) has yet to transition into material evidence. This deliberate distinction of material evidence is meant to alert to us that **data** which captures material evidence must directly be of an interpretive nature. The next step towards social interpretation of built space is thus to construct interpretive data. Interpretive **data** redirects traditional **data** interpretation with precision and rigour, because it structurally links the empirical origins of spatial **data** to the ideas we have about them. These structural links provide the bridges that resolve the leaps between ontological registers (cf. Lucas 2015) that trouble and restrict the value of many archaeological interpretations. Rigorous use of interpretive **data** also carefully delimits the ontological register of interpretation, i.e. it ensures that **data** is commensurate with the understanding sought through analysis."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.139324Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T21:55:18.966711Z","inner_id":44,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":45,"annotations":[{"id":45,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"b7AJkiome7","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-03T21:56:01.087000Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T21:56:01.087029Z","lead_time":39.575,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":45,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":9847410,"section":"3\/4","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.75,"text":"For neuroergonomics, the application of brain imaging in real-world scenarios is highly desirable as an investigation tool.

An option is to identify a set of discerning features of the interface and record the values of those features. This option is the one we used in this paper. A supervised learning algorithm can be used to build a prediction model essentially finding a pattern in the feature values that classifies an interface as either containing or not dark patterns and identifying which one. Advantage. Building on the work of Soe et al. (2020), a large selection of discerning features is used to describe the properties of online cookie banners from news outlets. The advantage of this approach over the other two is that interactive phenomena, such as invoking several interfaces, can be described and both visual and textual cues can be captured in the representation. In Section 3 we describe how the features from the Soe et al. (2020) dataset were processed before being used to train a prediction model. Limitation. The clear disadvantage is that some feature values will be difficult to be automatically \"harvested\" and virtually all feature values will require different AI post-processing techniques. Namely, after one algorithm (or a human) has identified and scraped the text, another is needed to analyse it. For example, text would require sentiment analysis, and the identification of widgets used would require a image processing. Instead, an ideal approach, and one open problem for future work consists in identifying the features whose values can be automatically scraped and post-processed and which are most relevant to distinguish a dark pattern. The more precise the definition of dark patterns, the easier it is to identify the relevant features. A separate limitation of the features approach is the challenge of humans being able to correctly label the **data** points with the right dark pattern.

SortingHat provides a unified view of all contributors, by merging identities in different **data** sources, mapping all of them to the same uuid which is used in enriched indexes. When **data** sources are similar, common fields are identified, so that **data** can be merged and to some extent compared. For example, for issue trackers there are fields with opening and closing dates. Finally, the fact that **data** is stored in Elasticsearch may allow for merging directly when querying, such as \"all **data** for all projects from date A to date B, authored by person P\". Consumer-agnostic. It is very difficult to know how some person will exploit the **data** in the future. Since our approach is \"retrieve and store\", stored **data** may be useful even long after it was retrieved, or by a different team. GrimoireLab makes as few assumptions about analysis or visualization tools as possible. Enriched indexes are usually flat because then they are easier to import in visualization and analysis tools (for example, import into a Pandas **data** frame), but this is most of it. Thanks to this approach, we have tested the exploitation of **data** with several visualization tools, and the most common toolsets used for analysis. Anything that can consume JSON documents from Elasticsearch can be easily used to visualize or further analyze **data** produced by GrimoireLab. Performance and efficiency. When retrieving **data** from many repositories, performance is an issue. From one point of view, **data** sources should be used efficiently to avoid unnecessary stress. From another, we want the **data** as soon as possible. To address the first approach, GrimoireLab builds on an extensive research of **data** source APIs and retrieval options, to avoid those that could cause trouble. This is one of the reasons for using a toolset like this if you are not familiar enough with the details of **data** retrieval: avoiding causing unnecessary pain to the **data** source.

NAISC-L is complementary to existing interlinking frameworks as it supports the creation of relationship links through an interlinking process that encourages the application of domain expert knowledge. Facilitating the application of domain expertise allows IPs to use their specialist knowledge of particular subject areas, as well as their tacit knowledge of the needs and interests of LAM users, for the creation of useful, interesting and creative interlinks. Additionally, the provision of provenance data, detailing IPs as the creators and curators of these interlinks, increases user trustworthiness.

For instance, [15] increases the receptive field by applying 7 × 7 filter size on fully convolutional network (FCN), this results in an outstanding segmentation performance of 99.7% accuracy on feline calicivirus images. In [16], [17], in order to tackle the challenge of imbalance between the foreground and background, a dice coefficient is ap- as SegNet [20] and U-net [21] which are capable of working in small number of datasets, gives us a suitable option for our dataset. Moreover, SegNet shows more superiority for having few parameters and hence faster to train, because it passes pooling indeces to the upsampling layers and does not use the heavy deconvolution layers. U-net has been applied in many works for segmentation of EM. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge no any work has been done on segmentation of EMs using SegNet, except for one work which uses SegNet directly without any network changes from the original one on sementation of yeast cells [22].

When applying IR-HARQ, simply performing the sequential puncturing may cause potential distribution distortion in retransmissions. As such, we propose a symbol-wise puncturing scheme to preserve the shaping distribution and realize the promised gain of PAS. First, we consider the standard PAS structure [7] and adopt the constant composition distribution matcher (CCDM) proposed in [17] as a DM to transform the input bits into amplitude symbols. Then, they are represented by their binary labels with a desired probability distribution, while the binary labels are termed as amplitude bits. After FEC encoding, the information bits excluding the amplitude bits and all the parity bits are called sign bits. We apply IR-HARQ in our work, i.e., transmitting **data** packet that is self-decodable for the first transmission and the redundant information for retransmissions. In this case, the traditional sequential puncturing will cause retransmissions with only the sign bits, which brings severe distribution distortion. To address this issue, we pair the amplitude bits and sign bits into a label sequence of shaped modulation symbols. Then, we perform symbol-wise puncturing on the label sequence. In our scheme, a certain proportion of the amplitude bits and sign bits are sent in each transmission to ensure the probability distribution. At the receiver, the a-priori information of the amplitude bits that have not be transmitted is calculated to enhance FEC decoding. Our simulation results indicate that our proposed symbol-wise puncturing can obtain stable shaping gain across the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the throughput over both AWGN and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh fading channels and realize the desired probability distribution with only little distortion in each transmission, while the gain of the sequential puncturing drops rapidly with the increase of retransmission times and the distribution of the sequential puncturing in retransmissions tends to be uniform. Note that for type-I and type-III HARQ, since the **data** packets in each transmission are self-decodable, there are enough amplitude bits to preserve the probability distribution. In other words, the conventional PAS would still work when it is integrated with these two types of HARQ. Therefore, we only consider IR-HARQ in our work."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.148454Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T22:07:33.289401Z","inner_id":72,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":73,"annotations":[{"id":73,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"zeKZ0o5Xww","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-03T22:07:58.300306Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T22:07:58.300333Z","lead_time":23.469,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":73,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":236196766,"section":"24\/47","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.511,"text":"Several Docker container images are also provided to run pre-configured versions of GrimoireLab, with all services already pre-installed.

In NR-IQA, Kang et al. [47] applied first a CNN successfully. Namely, the authors implemented a traditional CNN which accepts image patches of 32 × 32 and predicts the patches' quality independently from each other. The entire image's perceptual quality was obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the patches' quality scores. Similar to [47], Kim and Lee [48] trained a CNN on image patches but the patches' desired quality scores were determined by a traditional FR-IQA metric which restricts this method to the evaluation of artificially distorted images. Bare et al. [49] developed a network that operates on image patches similar to [47] but the patches target score is calculated from a traditional FR-IQA metric (feature similarity index [50]) similar to [48]. On the whole, the entire image's perceptual quality is estimated by the predicted feature similarity index [50] scores of the image patches. In contrast, Conde et al. [51] took a CNN backbone network and trained it using a loss function [52] which aims to minimize the mean squared error and maximize linear correlation coefficient between the predicted and ground-truth quality scores. Further, the authors applied several **data** augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flips, vertical flips, rotations, and random cropping. To handle images with different aspect ratios, Ke et al. [53] introduced a transformer [54] based NR-IQA model which applied a hashbased 2D absolute-position-encoding for embedding image patches extracted from multiple scales. In contrast, Zhu et al. [55] embedded the input images' original aspect ratios into the self-attention module of a swin transformer [56]. Sun et al. [57] introduced the distortion graph representation framework which contains a distortion type discrimination network aiming to discriminate between distortion types and a fuzzy prediction network for perceptual quality estimation. Liu et al. [58] introduced lifelong learning for NR-IQA to learn new distortion types without accessing to previous training data. First, the authors utilized a split-and-merge distillation strategy for compiling a single-head regression network. In the split phase, a distortion-specific generator was implemented for generating pseudo-features for unseen distortions. In the merge phase, these pseudo-features were coupled with pseudo-labels to distill knowledge about distortions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.148895Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T22:10:42.252769Z","inner_id":76,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":77,"annotations":[{"id":77,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Maybe"]},"id":"Lxc9OJDoeu","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-03T22:11:01.273848Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T22:11:01.273877Z","lead_time":17.613,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":77,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":236196766,"section":"11\/47","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.234,"text":"GrimoireLab components and procedure: The main component in this scenario is Perceval, which will retrieve **data** from the **data** sources API.

Our positive query implication problems relate to work in the description logic community on hybrid closed and open world query answering or DBoxes, in which the schema is divided into closed-world and open-world relations. Given a Boolean CQ, we want to find out if it holds in all instances that can add facts to the open-world relations but do not change the closed-world relations. In the non-Boolean case, the generalization is to consider which tuples from the initial instance are in the query answer on all such instances. Thus closed-world and open-world relations match our notion of visible and invisible, and the hybrid closed and open world query answering problem matches our notion of positive query implication, except that we restrict to the case where the open-world\/visible relations of the instance are empty. It is easy to see that this restriction is actually without loss of generality: one can reduce the general case to the case we study with a simple linear time reduction, making a closed-world copy R ′ of each open-world relation R, and adding an inclusion dependency from R ′ to R. As with the database community, the main distinction between our study of the Positive Query Implication problem and the prior work in the DL community concerns the classes of constraints considered. Lutz et al. [LSW12] study the complexity of this problem for the constraint languages EL and DL-LITE, giving a dichotomy between co-NP-hard and first-order rewritable sets of constraints. They also show that in all the tractable cases, the problem coincides with the classical open-world query answering problem. Franconi et al. [FIS11] show co-NP-completeness for a disjunction-free description logic.

The universal significance of boundaries asserted in the opening statements sets out a path that here is developed from an end user perspective (i.e. analysis seeking social interpretation) on archaeological evidence on built space. Starting with the archaeological built environment survey maps which an end user may acquire, I will go through a series of observations on the way such **data** is presented. This brings out the complications associated with the usability of the lines on archaeological maps; moving from archaeological evidence to physical evidence, to material evidence. The theoretical implications that follow demonstrate how we can make critical use of lines on maps for spatial analysis in support of social interpretation. In conclusion, this theory is placed in the context of the requirements for developing interpretive research in a GIS environment. This has profound consequences for how we conduct archaeological GIS and how we proceed to develop new research processes with GIS. The concept of (material) boundaries is used throughout to exemplify how the staged questioning of archaeological built environment survey maps plays out.

We secondly propose to use an established serious game [9] to simulate not only fraudulent scenarios but also normal operation of a make-to-stock production company through user interaction in a real ERP system, generating both normal and fraudulent behavior simultaneously. Additionally, this allows us to extend the business processes investigated by previous **data** generators from the purchase-to-pay (P2P) process to modeling normal and fraudulent activity in the well established order-to-cash (O2C) process as well. Based on our extended requirements, we then design multiple fraud scenarios in cooperation with auditing experts. We conduct multiple runs of our proposed **data** generation scheme and produce ERP system **data** of multiple fiscal years of operation, extracting raw **data** from the ERP system. The resulting **data** contains many multi-relational tables that offer different views on the recorded company's business process. Since many fraud detection approaches require single tables to operate, we additionally create ready to use datasets from a subset of our multi-relational **data** that can be directly used for measuring and comparing the performance of fraud detection systems.

Any AI computational system aiming to detect dark patterns should align to detectable issues that are already deemed illegal by authoritative sources. But there are only few (mandatory) legal rules in Europe constraining the use of dark patterns, and enforcement is slow in holding websites accountable. The only mandatory decision ascertaining any UI based aspect is dated of 2019 forbidding the use of pre-ticked boxes (of Justice of the European Union, 2019). From Article 7(3) of the GDPR (\"it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent\", it can be interpreted that privacy choices should be equal (e.g. parity in accept, reject and revoke choices) Nouwens et al., 2020b). Parity feature entails i) equal widgets, ii) equal number of times to either accept\/reject\/revoke consent, iii) across modalities (web, mobile and app setting levels) (Johanna Gunawan, 2021). This reasoning on feature parity needs still to be held definitive by court decisions as well for consistency in all EU. The ePrivacy Regulation draft 14 , being discussed in the European Council, as of today, is absent on the definition of dark patterns or UI features, even accepting the use of cookie walls (Council's version), considered as an onstructive dark pattern (Kretschmer et al., 2021;Gray et al., 2021). Such weak enforcement and the high rate of consent optimization enhanced by using faulty designs in cookie banners (Hils et al., 2020; at scale, facilitated by the use of consent management platforms, explain the recurrent use of dark patterns in cookie banners. In the future, we need to see a more serious approach to enforcement, either by courts, or by decisions issued by **data** protection authorities. That is the only way to ensure that automated systems can rely on the necessary legal certainty in identifying dark patterns by identifying concrete characteristics of design."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.150887Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T16:28:57.572700Z","inner_id":101,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":102,"annotations":[{"id":102,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Maybe"]},"id":"CzeDAfJ3Eb","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-05T16:29:15.559271Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T16:29:15.559298Z","lead_time":15.837,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":102,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":236447646,"section":"6\/11","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.545,"text":"We also used the ASMD Python API to select the proper datasets for our experiments.

The algorithm was named spreading factor congestion-aware ADR approach and is specified in Algorithm 1. The name of the algorithm came from the fact that it uses the congestion statuses of each spreading factor in the network to determine the best one for the end device that requested the ADR. The development of this algorithm was performed to answer the question: how can a modified Adaptive Data Rate algorithm be developed to efficiently manage and reduce signal interferences in LoRaWAN? And to carry out the defined research objective (i). The proposed algorithm has seven main global variables (i.e., snrList, sfList, uplinkCnt, optimizedSF, defaultMargin, snrLimit, sfUsageIndex). These variables are explained as follows: snrList: a list of SNR values to be used in determining the best **data** rate. The list is initially empty and is updated each time the end device sends an uplink to the network server. sfList: a list of SFs that corresponds to the collected SNR values. The list is also initially empty and is updated each time the end device sends an uplink to the network server. uplinkCnt: a counter to keep track of the number of uplinks that the end device has sent to the network server since the ADR was requested. optimizedSF: the SF that will represent the optimized **data** rate. This variable stores the value that the algorithm will calculate once enough **data** has been collected. defaultMargin: the device-specific margin. This value is given in the devices' datasheets. A value of 10 is used in this experiment as it is generally the value for most devices. snrLimit: a list of limits required for each SF for the receiver to be able to demodulate the received signal. These values are used in determining the margin required for optimizing the **data** rate. sfUsageIndex: a list of stored values representing the number of devices using each SF. The values will be used to determine the SF with the fewest devices using it. This list is one of the most important pieces required by the algorithm."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.155462Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T18:19:47.310115Z","inner_id":117,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":118,"annotations":[{"id":118,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"Z5Wltv3M-1","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-05T18:20:14.939399Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T18:20:14.939437Z","lead_time":26.282,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":118,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":14054650,"section":"6\/13","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.462,"text":"If our goal is to promote progress towards highquality MT, we should investigate the creation of more expressive cross-lingual representations.

However, to arrive at an 'interpretive GIS' and applying associate analytical tools, we must fully understand the extent of the opportunity for social interpretation. Many of the problems discussed so far tend to disappear into the background of 'archaeological evidencing'. It can be appreciated just how much influence the treatment of archaeological evidence has on exactly which kind of interpretive and analytical work is supported by it. At this stage we can ask, so why does it matter that our **data** best approximates a would-be inhabited built environment? What is its value, its contribution, its relevance? From the outset I placed the arguments in this chapter in the context of social interpretation, but until now virtually all effort has gone into preparing and seeing built environment **data** as material boundaries. What is the social interpretation of material boundaries? With social interpretation of material evidence, I seek to place the material as a fundamental part of social science. This is not an attempt to reformulate the many guises of social archaeology (see Preucel and Meskell 2007) under a new heading. It should be seen as part of recent calls for archaeology to act as a social science and to contribute to pertinent societal issues Kintigh et al. 2014;Smith 2015). In archaeology as a social science, it could be said that 'we are no longer concerned with how these materials can be interpreted; instead we are interested in how these materials intra-acted with past people' (Meirion Jones 2015: 336), specifying our interpretive process and purpose. From this vantage point, the difference between the purviews of archaeology and social science is all but gone. The synchronous mode of analysis of spatially determinant characteristics further emphasises these equal terms of operation."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.155870Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T18:23:02.348721Z","inner_id":122,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":123,"annotations":[{"id":123,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"BbD1q9DIN8","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-05T18:23:22.792529Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T18:23:22.792556Z","lead_time":18.898,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":123,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":199379465,"section":"1\/14","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.071,"text":"Recent studies have shown that patient-specific **data** can be utilized for the development of intelligent Healthcare Information Management Systems (HIMS), that support a wide range of supporting applications that enhance healthcare delivery platforms.

As previous work [22] has pointed out, we found many cases where AS path seen in control plane and AS path seen in **data** plane do not match. However, these paths can still show detour if the detour origin AS and the detour destination AS are still present in the traceroute observed AS path. We call such AS paths congruent. More specifically, we consider the detoured AS path congruent only if detour origin AS and detour return AS both are present in the traceroute-observed AS path in the same order (detour origin first). For example, if an AS path 'A B C D E' in control plane changed to 'A X B C E' in **data** plane where 'B' was detour origin and 'C' was detour destination, we consider it as a congruent path. To resolve traceroute path to AS path we used CAIDA ITDK and iPlane IP to AS mappings and in cases where no match was found we use longest prefix match on the global routing table for the hop IP. Then we map the longest prefix match to the AS that originated it. Out of all the IPs we saw in 163 traceroutes, only 44 could be mapped to an AS using the IP to AS datasets.

Local indices identify important information hubs, which distribute or merge information to a large number of other nodes, or select so-called rich-clubs of highly interconnected nodes. Global indices measure the organization of the network into small worlds where only neighboring regions exchange information, or whether the network is organized in a centralized way. Regions with high outflow are considered drivers of information transfer in the network. Efficient information transfer across the network is measured by efficiency or path length. Segregation characterized by groups of highly connected regions for specialization can be measured by the clustering coefficient (22).

Consequently spatial **data** and spatial analysis are criticised, because they assume a synchronicity that sits uneasily with time as developmental process. Galinié et al. (2004), Lefebvre (2009), andRodier et al. (2009) have developed an archaeologically and historically dynamic model of information on urban fabric as an alternative to the more pervasive time-sliced (a particular or aggregate moment in time) representation, called OH_FET (based on 'historical objects'). Such approach relies heavily on the equal availability of archaeological and historical dating evidence across areas of space. In practice it is not only unusual to have equivalent dating evidence for all archaeological evidence of an area of built environment, but it is also difficult to account for the states, conditions, and iterations of persisting elements within the built environment. This is especially true when modelling 'historical objects' based on combinations of social use, space, and time (Rodier et al. 2009;Lefebvre 2009). Spatial analysis assumes the input dataset is synchronous. In contrast, analysing dynamically modelled spatial **data** runs the risk of 'fetishising' the formation processes of archaeological evidence instead of (social) developmental processes.

Under the linear MMSE (LMMSE) optimality criterion and the average transmit power constraint, the jointly optimal transmit and receive waveforms are derived for use over an additive WSCS noise channel. It is well known that a WSCS noise model is better than a WSS model for the case in which data-like QAM interferences are present as well as an ambient Gaussian noise [1]. In contrast to the previous results only with an additive WSS noise, the optimal waveforms are shown in general to have nonzero spectral values on a frequency interval whose length is greater than that of the generalized Nyquist interval. This is because, unlike a WSS random process, a WSCS random process possesses non-zero correlation in the frequency domain among the components that are spaced integer multiples of the symbol rate apart [9]. To exploit such spectral correlation of the WSCS random process, a vectorized Fourier transform (VFT) technique is employed in [8]. This technique is motivated by the harmonic series representation [9] of a WSCS random process, and the use of that representation for joint Tx and Rx optimizations in cyclostationary interference and noise has been examined in [10] and [11]."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.157127Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:36:39.992783Z","inner_id":138,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":139,"annotations":[{"id":139,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"s2nQcsLKQn","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-05T23:37:24.037371Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:37:24.037424Z","lead_time":41.011,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":139,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":236196766,"section":"6\/47","subsection":3.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.128,"text":"SortingHat uses a very conservative approach to merging identities: it uses algorithms that are quite likely to only merge identities that really correspond with the same person.

For example, the naive algorithm of \"merge two identities if the email address is present in both, and it is exactly equal\", fails in large datasets for common cases such as \"root@localhost\", merging for example \"John Smith <root@localhost>\" with \"Mary Williams <root@localhost>\". SortingHat provides this algorithm, which can be activated, but we had to include a deny list with common addresses such as this \"root@localhost\" to make it useful. SortingHat periodically merges identities using these conservative algorithms, that can also be activated (or not) in its configuration. If more detail is needed, ingestion of identities **data** from reliable sources (such as company records, or FOSS Foundation **data** about its developers), or manual curation (usually via HatStall) can be used.

In the process, GrimoireELK also uses SortingHat, in the Identities Management area, for identifying new identities, and finding the corresponding unique (merged) identities. Since both raw and enriched indexes are Elasticsearch indexes, they are basically collections of JSON items (named \"documents\" in Elasticsearch). All usual operations on noSQL databases are possible on those indexes: retrieving one or more items given some constraints, aggregating values for certain fields for a certain selection of items, updating items matching certain values, etc. The other component, Cereslib, is a library providing an API with useful functionality for certain kinds of specialized functionality. The Cereslib API is invoked by GrimoireELK to run \"studies\", which produces some specific enriched indexes. Studies are specialized preanalysis, producing items with a specific aim in mind.

Mathematically, we formulate this problem as:\nI t * = argmax I t p I t |I s 1 , I s 2 , ..., I s N ,(1)\nwhere p(·) is a probability function. Due to the expensive accessibility of 3D **data** (e.g., depths) and a limited number of input views, it is hard to compute accurate 3D geometry from input source views. Therefore, our intuition is to develop an end-to-end framework that combines geometry estimation and image synthesis, to eliminate the error propagation issue. We achieve this goal by estimating target-view depth and source-view visibility for target pixels directly under the target view."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.159481Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:51:55.032169Z","inner_id":161,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":162,"annotations":[{"id":162,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Maybe"]},"id":"jIP209Pg_o","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-05T23:52:09.113337Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:52:09.113364Z","lead_time":12.704,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":162,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":246165803,"section":"14\/45","subsection":3.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.311,"text":"The street used as a reference had very few anomalies, was recently paved, and was mostly flat in all its extensions. \"Transmisiones\" street is located in front of a section of the Tecnologico de Monterrey-Mexico City campus.

The free space propagation loss is proportional to the square of the carrier frequency. With a wavelength of about 5 mm, the free space propagation loss at 60 GHz is 28 decibels (dB) more than at 2.4 GHz [14].  Besides, the Oxygen absorption in the 60 GHz band has a peak, ranging from 15 to 30 dB\/km [30]. The channel characterization in [31] shows that the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel suffers from higher attenuation than the line-of-sight (LOS) channel. The large scale fading F (d) can be modeled as follows.\nF (d) = P L(d 0 ) + 10nlog 10 d d 0 − S σ ,(1)\nwhere P L(d 0 ) is the path loss at reference distance d 0 , n is the path loss exponent, and S σ is the showing loss. σ is the standard deviation of S σ . In table I, we list the statistical parameters of the path loss model obtained in a corridor, a LOS hall, and a NLOS hall [31]. We can observe that the path loss exponent in the LOS hall is 2.17, while the path loss exponent in the NLOS hall is 3.01. To combat severe propagation loss, directional antennas are employed at both transmitter and receiver to achieve a high antenna gain. For the small-scale propagation effects in the 60 GHz band, it is found that the multipath effect is not obvious with directional antennas. By using circular polarization and receiving antennas of narrow beam width, multipath reflection can be suppressed [32], [33]. In the LOS channel model in the conference room environment proposed in IEEE 802.11ad [9], the direct path contains almost all the energy, and nearly no other multipath components exist. In this case, the channel can be regarded as the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. In the NLOS channel, there is no direct path, and the number of paths with significant energy is small. To achieve high **data** rate and maximize the power efficiency [34], mmWave communications mainly rely on the LOS transmission."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.159841Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:53:14.618189Z","inner_id":166,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":167,"annotations":[{"id":167,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"FqJgokUYlc","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-05T23:53:34.720006Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:53:34.720041Z","lead_time":18.705,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":167,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":218971725,"section":"8\/10","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.8,"text":"We described a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach to approximate the optimal two-phase design for fitting a regression model using design-based estimators.

This, together with the fact that GrimoireLab is for now a moving target, continuously evolving, may make it complex to use in some cases.

Intuitively speaking, coherence is a correlation of two signals in the frequency domain (15). Other connectivity measures consider the phase of the oscillations in the electrophysiological signals, the so-called measures of synchronization. The phase indicates whether the oscillation is at a specific time point t at a peak, trough, or transitions between these two states (such as for instance, zero crossings). If two signals exhibit the same phases at the same point in time, they are said to oscillate synchronously. Determining the phase of two signals allows calculating the difference in phase, the phase lag, which in turn may inform us about propagation effects, if the one signal exhibits a later phase than the other signal. The phase lag is suggested to reflect signal propagation and can be studied to examine effective connectivity. In addition to bivariate measures that consider pairs of signals, multivariate measures are designed in order to remove shared properties between multiple signals, such as, for example, partial coherence (16). Most measures of effective connectivity are described under the umbrella term Granger causality (17). This concept considers two signals X and Y and examines whether the activity at time point t of signal X can be predicted (statistically) by the activity at the earlier time points t-k of signal Y. Among them, partial directed coherence (18) and directed transfer function (19) are commonly used to study epilepsy. Next to these **data** driven analysis approaches, effective connectivity can also be estimated based on underlying biophysical models with a priori assumptions about the organization of the network as in Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and other neural mass models. DCM in EEG or MEG takes biologically plausibility of causal models into account, and thus yields an informed estimate of connectivity (20)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.166548Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:05:48.546025Z","inner_id":189,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":190,"annotations":[{"id":190,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"4ebhEUIcR_","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T00:06:12.824919Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:06:12.824952Z","lead_time":22.609,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":190,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":59514737,"section":"2\/8","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.25,"text":"In the space scene, IRST work process is that system scans the certain field according to the prior information, and transmits image **data** to the infrared image real-time processing system for processing.

This finding was counter to some of the initial studies using CFS **data** to examine trends in aggravated assaults (Ashby, 2020; Mohler et al., Table 3 Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA models. 17.53*** 2020) after the initial onset of COVID-19. This discrepancy could be due to measurement differences as our measure also included shootings in addition to different types of assaults. However, these initial studies only examined trends until April or mid-May of 2020 and were perhaps unable to account for longer term effects of the pandemic. For example, recent research found an increase in gun violence from the beginning of the pandemic through March 2021 across several U.S. states, including Texas generally and the Houston region specifically, when compared to the same time-period the year prior. The increases in gun violence were attributed to both prolonged psychological distress and increased gun sales resulting from the pandemic (Ssentongo et al., 2021). The current results also suggest that COVID-19 was associated with increased demands for police responses to violence, even after the initial wave of the virus. Third, the findings indicated that officers were engaged in more frequent self-initiated patrol activities compared to the pre-pandemic data. This increase remained after the death of George Floyd (when compared to pre-pandemic data), but at a lower rate. These observed changes to proactive patrol could also be attributed to changes in the routine activities of citizens. Again, the **data** showed that three of the reactive call types significantly decreased post-pandemic and another three reactive call types experienced no changes in frequency. As Ashby (2020) noted, a reduction in reactive CFS could create additional time for officers to focus on other tasks, such as proactivity. The current results may also lend further support to the findings from Lum, Koper, et al. (2020) demonstrating how proactivity is often manifested as generalized patrol even after the pandemic, as well as Maskály et al.

While there was initial concern that the pandemic may have necessitated a move to precautionary policing, a recent survey revealed that citizens are not supportive of reducing preventative patrol even during the pandemic . In this regard, decreases in reactive demands for police services coupled with citizen expectations of police services during the pandemic could account for this increase."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.167551Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:09:24.264043Z","inner_id":200,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":201,"annotations":[{"id":201,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Maybe"]},"id":"fV-tljyg9o","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T00:10:08.315827Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:10:08.315853Z","lead_time":40.285,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":201,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":202915961,"section":"2\/6","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.333,"text":"To study the spatial and structural organization of plant cover diversity the key area was chosen.

The formalization of expert knowledge from different domains (e.g., expertise regarding plant mechanical processes and knowledge about thermo-chemical and other physical mechanisms of chemical processes) is particularly challenging and reveals the uniqueness of the presented approach. Due to the lack of data, deep neuronal networks cannot always be trained, and other ML algorithms must be combined to quantify and expand expert knowledge from different domains. Figure 1 shows the continuous learning procedure and the interaction between the different parts of an AI-based hybrid model, i.e., **data** measurement, expert knowledge, and ML algorithms with special metrics for automated evaluation (autoML) [5]. With this procedure, expert knowledge can be continuously quantified, and the understanding of the plant and chemical processes can be expanded. Along with a cloud-based IT solution from Engineering Data Intelligence (EDI Ltd., Pfinztal-Berghausen, Germany) called the \"EDI hive Internet of things (IoT) Framework\" (short EDI hive), the process of capturing expert knowledge and the integration of process engineering fundamentals, AI-based modeling, and the subsequent application of the AIbased hybrid model in power plant operation can be achieved. In this paper, the advantages of AI-based hybrid models in industrial applications are discussed, the experimental results are presented together with the modeling results, and the continuous software-based support of this process through EDI hive is demonstrated."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.168072Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:10:46.453117Z","inner_id":203,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":204,"annotations":[{"id":204,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"KKEKrZ-QNY","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T00:11:01.876882Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:11:01.876908Z","lead_time":13.79,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":204,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":249258070,"section":"43\/119","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.361,"text":"Law enforcement executives have noted the impact of the pandemic on police activities.

A case in point is the translation of film subtitles, where the target side is often shortened as well as translated (Pedersen, 2007;Fishel et al., 2012). Anecdotal evidence suggests that MT systems easily learn the length ratio, but truncate the texts in an erratic way that has a negative effect on translation quality."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.170017Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:42:49.575994Z","inner_id":229,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":230,"annotations":[{"id":230,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"xuhVqs1jOW","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T00:43:00.342153Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T00:43:00.342182Z","lead_time":9.23,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":230,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":54551628,"section":"15\/17","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.882,"text":"Krakauer and colleagues bolstered their experimental fi ndings by comparing them with a statistical model of movements of the arm and wrist.

Szegedy et al. (2014) reported that one can inject imperceptible perturbations to fool deep models. Among the proposed defenses, Adversarial Training (AT) (Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2015;Madry et al. 2018; is the promising and representative approach to training robust models (Athalye, Carlini, and Wagner 2018). Recently, Salman et al. (2020) showed that adversarially learned features could transfer better than standardly trained models, while various works (Volpi et al. 2018;Sinha, Namkoong, and Duchi 2018;Shankar et al. 2018;Ford et al. 2019;Qiao, Zhao, and Peng 2020;Yi et al. 2021;Gokhale et al. 2021) adopt samplewise adversarial training or adversarial **data** augmentation to improve OOD robustness. However, most discussions are limited to distributional robustness w.r.t. Wasserstein distance. The small perturbations used in AT make it less practical to account for real-world OOD scenarios (e.g., correlation to backgrounds), thus  incorporated low-rank structured priors into AT for this kind of large **data** distribution shifts. Moreover, previous work shows that there seems to be a trade-off between the two distribution shifts: an algorithm that performs well on one task tends to perform poorly on the other (Ye et al. 2022). Instead, in this work, our proposed method can achieve fair performance on both correlation shift and diversity shift tasks."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.172522Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T14:46:52.350686Z","inner_id":234,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":235,"annotations":[{"id":235,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"lnMPkn56Db","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T14:47:00.761137Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T14:47:00.761163Z","lead_time":7.009,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":235,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":236196766,"section":"4\/47","subsection":9.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.085,"text":"Full-size  DOI: 10.7717\/peerj-cs.601\/ fig-6 writers, making it possible to live-stream **data** or serialize it to database management systems.

Lucas (2015) cautions against the dominant view of archaeological evidence as fragments. However, it is fair to say that there is an important discrepancy in terms of completeness between traces of a built environment and spaces of a built environment. We know that due to site formation processes, there is no perfect preservation of past situations. Yet, social interpretations in archaeology are usually concerned with understanding situations that occurred in the past. By stating 'finding remnants of an assemblage is not the same as finding an assemblage itself', Lucas (2015: 321) urges us to reflect on what survives: archaeological evidence seen as relics. In the context of going from traces to spaces, metaphorically a past lost to a past found, the resolve lies in redressing fragments as surviving traces of entities from a past situation. 4 Following the 3 It may be worth mentioning here that with new recording technologies, especially high-resolution 3D photogrammetry and laser scanning or LiDAR, a cleanly presented 2D archaeological map as end product could systematically refer back to the much fuller source of information of the original digital records. Kyriakidis E (2016, personal communication) argued the advantages of a similar workflow for digitally producing the 2D map of ancient Eleusis from 3D information.

ARIMA models were used to forecast weekly total call count frequencies as well as weekly call counts broken down across 18 different call types. The frequency of total CFS was estimated to be significantly below what was forecasted for the model for multiple consecutive weeks after pandemic lockdowns occurred in six of ten cities. Three of the remaining four cities also saw non-significant decreases in total call counts. New Orleans saw an initial decrease, followed by a two-week spike in calls, then another decrease. In terms of specific call types, crime-related CFS did not deviate from expected frequencies. Domestic violence calls increased in three cities, decreased in one city, and were in the expected ranges in three cities. Disturbance calls increased in four cities but remained the same in six cities. Drug-related calls were lower than expected in two cities. Finally, traffic-related calls saw an initial decrease, but then slowly increased in later weeks of the study period (Ashby, 2020)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.175106Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T14:58:40.631312Z","inner_id":268,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":269,"annotations":[{"id":269,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"nEh_OnJP0f","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T14:59:07.315709Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T14:59:07.315735Z","lead_time":25.471,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":269,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":12790199,"section":"1\/21","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.048,"text":"Speech interaction allows humans to convey complex beliefs and desires efficiently.

For example, databases of drone and satellite images can help track and categorize endangered animal species down to the individual animal, helping re-population efforts and the fight against poaching. In addition, machine learning algorithms can offer insights and solutions into the trends of certain animal populations, their movements, habits, and preferences, as well as mapping food availability and predict migration routes. AI-equipped technologies are also employed in the fight against climate change [31] and in the development of alternatives to fossil fuels [21].

This finding was counter to some of the initial studies using CFS **data** to examine trends in aggravated assaults (Ashby, 2020; Mohler et al., Table 3 Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA models. 17.53*** 2020) after the initial onset of COVID-19. This discrepancy could be due to measurement differences as our measure also included shootings in addition to different types of assaults. However, these initial studies only examined trends until April or mid-May of 2020 and were perhaps unable to account for longer term effects of the pandemic. For example, recent research found an increase in gun violence from the beginning of the pandemic through March 2021 across several U.S. states, including Texas generally and the Houston region specifically, when compared to the same time-period the year prior. The increases in gun violence were attributed to both prolonged psychological distress and increased gun sales resulting from the pandemic (Ssentongo et al., 2021). The current results also suggest that COVID-19 was associated with increased demands for police responses to violence, even after the initial wave of the virus. Third, the findings indicated that officers were engaged in more frequent self-initiated patrol activities compared to the pre-pandemic data. This increase remained after the death of George Floyd (when compared to pre-pandemic data), but at a lower rate. These observed changes to proactive patrol could also be attributed to changes in the routine activities of citizens. Again, the **data** showed that three of the reactive call types significantly decreased post-pandemic and another three reactive call types experienced no changes in frequency. As Ashby (2020) noted, a reduction in reactive CFS could create additional time for officers to focus on other tasks, such as proactivity. The current results may also lend further support to the findings from Lum, Koper, et al. (2020) demonstrating how proactivity is often manifested as generalized patrol even after the pandemic, as well as Maskály et al. (2021) results showing increases in directed or extra patrols since COVID-19. While there was initial concern that the pandemic may have necessitated a move to precautionary policing, a recent survey revealed that citizens are not supportive of reducing preventative patrol even during the pandemic . In this regard, decreases in reactive demands for police services coupled with citizen expectations of police services during the pandemic could account for this increase."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.176532Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T15:19:54.187794Z","inner_id":288,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":289,"annotations":[{"id":289,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"VEhKEQ97IC","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-06T15:20:29.271412Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T15:20:29.271439Z","lead_time":5.917,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":289,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":38256305,"section":"4\/49","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.082,"text":"Satellite Remote Sensing (RS) **data** and Geographical Information System (GIS) software have a huge potential and wide application in assessing and categorizing natural hazards [37][38][39][40].

In contrast, observational **data** are often easier and cheaper to acquire, so they are more likely to include long-term outcome observations. Nevertheless, observational **data** are very susceptible to unmeasured confounding, which can lead to severely biased treatment effect estimates.

First, the child appears to parse the compound inappropriately, representing it as a single syllable. Second, it is orthographically plausible to represent the k sound with ck; however, in American English, ck can only occur after a short vowel; hence, this child's misspelling represents an implicit awareness of permissible orthotactic sequences, but not their constraints on word position.

Questions can certainly be asked about to what extent treating evidence empirically is the only valid structure of reasoning. A critical realist would not deny indigenous knowledge causal power. In explanation (why something happened or occurred in that way), indigenous knowledge will play an equally valid role alongside history, personal agencies and memories, sociocultural systems and categories, and human-environmental relationships, both internal and external to the situation or phenomenon being studied. What such knowledges demand is a structural linkage of that understanding to archaeological evidence.

The use of standardized colorimetry defines colors in a device-independent space and therefore forms a first step toward achieving device independent color.

Inference aims at assessing the theory space in light of the observed **data** in order to estimate points or intervals in this space that are compatible with the **data** as well as test hypotheses for data-driven decision-making. In frequentist statistics the main tools for these tasks are estimates based on the well-developed methodology of maximum-likelihood estimation, confidence intervals construction and test statistics. In a Bayesian context, most inference tasks derive their results from methods that aim to compute posterior densities of the form p(θ|x). A major problem for both approaches, however, are likelihood-free settings, i.e. experimental situations where samples x ∼ p(x|θ) are available but evaluating the likelihood p(x|θ) is computationally intractable. The field of likelihood-free inference thus aims to develop methods that allow us to still perform the desired inference tasks without requiring explicit evaluation of the model. High-Energy Physics **data** analysis is a prominent example of such a likelihood-free problem, which appears due to a rich, but unobservable evolution of the original particle collision through many latent intermediate states z i culminating into a high-dimensional measurement x. While the evolution probability itself is p(x, z|θ) is tractable, the model of the observable **data** p(x|θ) = dz p(x, z|θ) is not. Classical approaches to likelihood-free inference often use simulation and summary statistics f (x) to derive a low-dimensional approximate model p(f (x)|θ) to which the standard methodology can then be applied. More recently a new breed of methods are developed that aim to use machine learning to eschew an explicit approximation of the statistical model, in favor of directly targeting only the model-derived quantities required for inference. In this work we add to this program by presenting a method to learn a test statistic with best average power. For models which lie in the asymptotic regime, this is equivalent to the profile likelihood ratio test statistic, which is a key quantity in frequentist **data** analysis for models that incorporate systematic uncertainties through nuisance parameters."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.182266Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:28:35.665783Z","inner_id":318,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":319,"annotations":[{"id":319,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"dIb2vddgSp","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-07T00:28:51.027273Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:28:51.027300Z","lead_time":13.963,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":319,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":249258070,"section":"43\/119","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.361,"text":"Additionally, Maskály et al.

In terms of specific call types, crime-related CFS did not deviate from expected frequencies. Domestic violence calls increased in three cities, decreased in one city, and were in the expected ranges in three cities.

This finding was counter to some of the initial studies using CFS **data** to examine trends in aggravated assaults (Ashby, 2020; Mohler et al., Table 3 Interrupted time series analysis using ARIMA models. 17.53*** 2020) after the initial onset of COVID-19. This discrepancy could be due to measurement differences as our measure also included shootings in addition to different types of assaults. However, these initial studies only examined trends until April or mid-May of 2020 and were perhaps unable to account for longer term effects of the pandemic. For example, recent research found an increase in gun violence from the beginning of the pandemic through March 2021 across several U.S. states, including Texas generally and the Houston region specifically, when compared to the same time-period the year prior. The increases in gun violence were attributed to both prolonged psychological distress and increased gun sales resulting from the pandemic (Ssentongo et al., 2021). The current results also suggest that COVID-19 was associated with increased demands for police responses to violence, even after the initial wave of the virus. Third, the findings indicated that officers were engaged in more frequent self-initiated patrol activities compared to the pre-pandemic data. This increase remained after the death of George Floyd (when compared to pre-pandemic data), but at a lower rate. These observed changes to proactive patrol could also be attributed to changes in the routine activities of citizens. Again, the **data** showed that three of the reactive call types significantly decreased post-pandemic and another three reactive call types experienced no changes in frequency. As Ashby (2020) noted, a reduction in reactive CFS could create additional time for officers to focus on other tasks, such as proactivity. The current results may also lend further support to the findings from Lum, Koper, et al. (2020) demonstrating how proactivity is often manifested as generalized patrol even after the pandemic, as well as Maskály et al. (2021) results showing increases in directed or extra patrols since COVID-19. While there was initial concern that the pandemic may have necessitated a move to precautionary policing, a recent survey revealed that citizens are not supportive of reducing preventative patrol even during the pandemic . In this regard, decreases in reactive demands for police services coupled with citizen expectations of police services during the pandemic could account for this increase."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.182927Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:31:25.507308Z","inner_id":327,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":328,"annotations":[{"id":328,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"AT2HFFzkgg","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-07T00:31:46.039386Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:31:46.039424Z","lead_time":18.599,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":328,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":24865762,"section":"1\/34","subsection":2.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.029,"text":"Among the numerous techniques useful for the **data** representation or decomposition of time-evolving datasets, we may distinguish several seminal techniques like those based on variance's decomposition such as principal component analysis (PCA) [3] and its probabilistic formulation [4] or nonlinear extensions [5][6][7]; techniques using eigenfunctions of Markov matrices reflecting the (local) geometry and density of the **data** [8,9]; or more recent approaches exploiting the Koopman operator theory [10][11][12]."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.182995Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:31:46.071497Z","inner_id":328,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":329,"annotations":[{"id":329,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Maybe"]},"id":"ou3THxvxzK","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-07T00:31:55.455327Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:31:55.455360Z","lead_time":8.054,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":329,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":249258070,"section":"51\/119","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.429,"text":"This study relies on CFS **data** provided by the Houston Police Department (HPD) based on records from their Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.

The GFZ Potsdam institute provides useful algorithms to convert Cube format to MiniSeed format. During the recorded period, many of the 80 stations deployed lost the GPS signal sometimes, leading to more than one daily file. We found out that the registered **data** had some gaps, meaning that for certain periods of time the station did not register. The most probable cause of this is the loss of GPS signal. Fortunately, MiniSeed files are written with an absolute scale of time, thus, allowing us to identified and exclude these gaps. Another step we performed was to convert MiniSeed into SAC in order to choose the more suitable type file to work with. On the other hand SAC files have the time information not in absolute values but in a single time vector from 1 to the end of samples. Therefore, gaps could not be well identified using this type of files. For this reason we decided to work directly with the MiniSeed data. To reduce computation time we transformed the **data** into .mat format taking only the pieces of signal we needed. Indeed, we cut the signal 30 s before that **data** and 60 s after each shot.

Our methods address such limitations in that: 1) The projection module in our feature learning branch adapts the image representation to a space more suitable for contrastive loss; 2) We use different loss functions to learn the features and classifiers and conclude supervised contrastive loss can be a better substitute for cross-entropy in learning features from imbalanced data; 3) We use a single classifier learning function to predict the class labels for each sample, which avoids the gap between training and testing.

Relative to the situation without the context, they are biased to perceive the target in a context of weak contrast when the target can perceptually group well with the context, as if the context fills in the target. Meanwhile, they are biased not to perceive the target in a context of strong contrast, as if the context suppresses the perception, regardless of whether it could perceptually group well with the would-be target.

The chemical classification should not be expected to be amenable to a more detailed level of interpretation, paralleling the outcome of the other p-XRF  investigation at San Vincenzo on soils from different excavated contexts (Di Renzoni, et al., 2016). For sure, there is room for the analytical protocol to be refined beyond that described in the present study in order to improve accuracy, to allow additional elements to be included in the **data** set and to calibrate with respect to the corresponding **data** obtained by destructive analysis such as benchtop WDXRF (Jones & Campbell, in press). We suggest that p-XRF should not be habitually compared to ICP\/NAA and repeatedly be found wanting in its inability to cover all elements and \/or display equivalent levels of accuracy for all elements. At the same time p-XRF should not develop a 'scatter gun' reputation, generating one-off **data** which cannot be reused or can only be used for internalin-house -purposes. It is time to look boldly at its greatest attribute, that is, that of non-destructive, in situ, analysis aimed at analysing large quantities of sherds; equally important is our ability to formulate appropriate questions that it can answer, satisfactorily and conclusively. In the case of impasto ware there is already a good understanding of the origin and production of these wares; so the need now is to process large quantities of newly excavated material, and to assess whether they are imported or not. This study has shown that this type of assessment (local vs non local) is indeed feasible and effective. Coarse wares are amongst the most common fabrics found in many archaeological sites so the implication of the results of this study goes beyond the remit of our work on Stromboli.  \n"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.184601Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:38:31.038581Z","inner_id":348,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":349,"annotations":[{"id":349,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"xBkfjw5JyP","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-07T00:38:54.410864Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:38:54.410891Z","lead_time":21.895,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":349,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":55381955,"section":"1\/12","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.083,"text":"The origin of the knee in the all-particle spectrum of CRs is inextricably connected with the issue of the end of the Galactic CR spectrum and the transition to extragalactic CRs: in Ref.

The approximation of AGCM is a mild one: it amounts to the truncation of an asymptotic series with respect to 1\/s, s → ∞, where s > 0 is the parameter of the Laplace transform with respect to t of the above hyperbolic PDE. This truncation is done only on the first iteration. Next, a numerical method is developed within the framework of the resulting mathematical model. Next, a theorem is proved, which claims that this method delivers a good approximation for the exact solution of that CIP without any a priori knowledge of a small neighborhood of that solution. The common perception of global convergence is that one should obtain correct solution if iterations would start from almost any point. That theorem claims, however, that a small neighborhood of the exact solution is achieved if iterations would start not from any point but rather from a function which can be obtained without any knowledge of that small neighborhood. That theorem was confirmed in numerical studies of both computationally simulated and experimental data. 3-d experimental **data** were treated in [8,6,20].

This effect may be a consequence of differences in blood glucose combined with physical effects in the gut. Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, the results suggest that if kiwifruit contributes to maintenance of satiety, its effects on appetite are worth investigating further with the fully validated appetite scale in the context of obesity management. Similarly, assuming that satiety reflects physiological state, and given the results obtained with guar [18], the effects of kiwifruit on cognition should be explored in further research. Although the hunger results were possibly limited by experienced hunger not being a complete measure of appetite [19], it correlates with appetite.

The cloud effects of forests estimated in a recent study 58 based on a different MODIS-derived cloud dataset 59 (produced by a different retrieval algorithm) revealed a similar global dominance of cloud enhancement and regional prevalence of cloud inhibition (e.g., in Amazon). Yet regional inconsistencies remained for Southeast US and Central Africa, where the identified cloud inhibition could be weakened or absent with alternative cloud **data** (ref. 58 and Supplementary Fig. 13). This emphasizes the need of using multi-source cloud **data** to improve the robustness of the estimated cloud effects while reducing the uncertainty from data. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cloud inhibition in these regions is indirectly supported by lower sensible heat over forests, which is in line with the mesoscale circulation mechanism, as well as the consistency between potential cloud inhibition and the actual cloud increase over forest loss locations (i.e., Southeast US hotspot). While more direct observational evidence is always desirable to help resolve inconsistencies, the lack of observations in regions like Central Africa, which have received less attention than the Amazon, hinders comparisons against other available evidence.

The distributions of UV intensity were not uniform. With one UV lamp installation, the UV fluence rate decreased as the distance away from the UV lamps increased.

This can be explained by limitations in the measurement process. UV meter sensor can only cover a certain irradiance angle. Therefore, when measuring the UV intensity of two lamps symmetrically positioned on wall, it will not be able to cover the entire incident light, leading to a slight decrease in fluence rate.

Adaptation more than mitigation was confirmed to be a priority for Africa. Beside the scientific and technical aspects, the solution to most of the constraints could be a comprehensive approach able to consider not only scientific and ecological issues but also socio-economic dynamics (land tenure, urbanisation, jobs opportunities, market, prices, investments, etc), which may influence the success and the long-term sustainability of a RI network. Science alone is not always enough, thus mediation among scientists, traditional leaders and agriculture  extension officers could help in facing some of the crucial practical aspects towards implementation. A coherent and thorough analysis and prioritisation of all these issues can therefore help in developing a range of options suitable for specific 'on field' conditions (at national or regional levels). Among the possible options, the developed countries' approach for an RI network on GHG observations was recognised as not being directly applicable to Africa, for different reasons, of which the most important are: high costs for implementation and maintenance, lack of qualified personnel and specialised companies, problems with energy supply, accessibility and protection of field sites, and challenging eco-climatic conditions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-03T18:21:17.189876Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:51:23.583272Z","inner_id":383,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":384,"annotations":[{"id":384,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Maybe"]},"id":"s4rcPCpEVf","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-07T00:51:34.787129Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T00:51:34.787158Z","lead_time":9.515,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":384,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"bacb7250-data2lab_2023-02-18_JZ.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"corpusid":159187248,"section":"17\/67","subsection":1.0,"section_pos_in_pct":0.254,"text":"3.2.7.

The drainage capacity of the Kerunga canal is sufficient to carry the storm water it receives and hence no flooding occurs in the Kerunga canal catchment. The simulated inundated area is around 166 ha, which falls mainly in the Pungi canal catchment under this scenario (Figure 14). canals and the construction of some new drains in the Pungi canal system were incorporated into scenario Sc-2. The bottom level of the canal becomes silted up in some places, or the channel sections become narrow due to encroachment.
