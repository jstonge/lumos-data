    "text": "All of our discussion throughout the paper will be completely model - independent and can be applied to any BSM scenario , including supersymmetry , extra dimensions , little Higgs theory etc . In Section 5 , however , we shall use a specific example in order to illustrate each of our three proposed methods . Instead of considering a decay chain of some BSM model , we chose to select an example which is already present in the Tevatron data , and will soon be tested at the LHC as well : the dilepton event samples from top quark pair production and from W -pair production . Those two dilepton samples satisfy all of our assumptions , and would be a perfect testing ground for any new ideas about mass measurements in missing energy events from new physics . In Section 5 we will show that using any one of our three M T 2 -based mass measurement methods , one can in principle determine the mass of each of the three particles : top quark , W -boson , and neutrino , independently and in a completely modelindependent fashion . Section 6 contains a summary and a discussion of our main results . In Appendix A we collect all relevant formulas for the endpoint functions M ( n , p , c ) T 2,max ( M c , p T ) .",

    "text": "Fluorescence corresponding to the Alpha variant could be detected , as this variant also harbors S : Δ69/70 . However , the fluorescence plateau values detected were considerably lower compared to those of Omicron . In addition , since Alpha has been completely displaced by Delta , the presence of the former variant in the monitored wastewater is unexpected . It should be also highlighted that the data obtained from the National Genomic Surveillance Network regarding the SARS - CoV-2 variants that circulated during each period were critical for the interpretation of the RT - PCR findings . This is based on the fact that the developed assay aims at a specific viral genomic target . In our case , up to 16 December 2021 , the vast majority of the genomic sequences that were characterized from Thessaloniki belonged to the Delta variant ( 92.8 % , i.e. , 1059 out of 1141 clinical samples that underwent typing ) ( National Public Health Organization - Greece ( EODY ) , 2021c ) and this assisted in drawing safe conclusions about the performance of our wastewater monitoring methodology .",

    "text": "The spring constant of the PEG micropillars was determined using an AFM cantilever as a reference . First , the cantilevers spring constant was determined using the integrated tool of a JPK BioAFM ( atomic force microscope , JPK Instruments AG ) . To calibrate the micropillars , the AFM cantilever was vertically fi xed in a custom - made micromanipulator such that its tip was situated approximately 1 μ m below the top of the PEG pillar . Both the cantilever and pillar were made to bend by moving highlighting the differences observed in Figure 2 ( a ) . The comparison in Figure 2 ( b ) illustrates that for forces smaller than 7 nN only a few more maximum force counts are observed on the α v β 3 -integrin antagonist than on the α 5 β 1 -integrin antagonist . In contrast , at forces above 7 nN the number of maximum force counts on the α 5 β 1 -integrin antagonist is up to four times greater than on the α v β 3 -integrin antagonist . In general , the data shows a trend towards higher maximum force counts at higher force levels for cells on the α 5 β 1 -integrin specifi c antagonist , suggesting that these cells must exert a greater pulling force on the pillars when adhering to them .",

Bootstraps that accommodate the dependence relationships that may be present in time series is an open - ended topic 72 , because generally there is no resampling scheme that logically guarantees resampled data to be equiprobable under the true generating process , in contrast to the bootstrap argument for independent samples . Nonetheless , in our case , the likelihood calculation sums over observations and expectations of change from one timestep to the next , and it is these transitions that are assumed to be independent across time periods and approximately independent between types . Unaccounted dependence between observations enters by either failures of the Markovian assumption in the true generating process , or by effects of competition between types induced by finite population size . We resample in a way that approximates independence and roughly preserves population size so that resampled transitions have similar frequencies to the originals .",

We define the agents V and assigned them to specific CBGs based on the population size of each CBG documented in the ACS demographic data . Then using the dwelling locations of the devices provided in the Veraset data , we considered two devices to be in contact if they presented in the same POI at the same time . Here , the dwelling locations of the devices are defined according to the time the devices spent in a location . We use 5 mins as the threshold amount of time to filter out the locations where the devices might be waiting for traffic lights . The length of the overlap of their time spent in the POI is denoted as the duration of their contact . As such , we create an empirical weighted contact network among the devices in the Veraset data . In addition , we estimated the home CBGs of the devices . The links between any pair of CBGs can be extracted . Based on the proportion between the population size of empirical data and the synthetic population , we have a scalar to quantify the difference between the number of devices and synthetic agents . The scalar is then applied to determine the number of links that should be synthesized for each pair of CBGs . The weights of these links follow the distribution of the weights in the empirical contact network . Next , we assign the links to the synthetic agents in these two CBGs , where the degree distribution for the agents is consistent with the degree distribution of the devices in the same CBGs in the empirical data . We generate and assign links by repeating the above steps for all pairs of CBGs . This approach allows for creating synthetic contact networks based on actual mobility data and to maintain key structural and attribute information of the agents and the networks .",

Nevertheless , the reconstruction problem still makes sense in this case : the common approach is to assume some simple and reasonable form of the dynamics , and recover the parameters of the model which explain the data in the most accurate and minimalistic way ; this is crucial for understanding the basic mechanisms of the spreading process , as well as for making further predictions without overfitting .

    "text": "An essential part of the sensor system that requires further elaboration for technically viable point - of - care operation is the pump source . Our current demonstration relies on a bulky benchtop - type Nd : YLF laser , emitting pulses with an energy of 500 nJ at a rather low repetition rate of 20 Hz . The pulse length amounts to 20 ns , leading to a low duty cycle of 4 × 10 −7 and an accordingly low average output power , which requires a long integration interval of 2 s for the read - out camera . In a point - of - care system , this bulky solid - state laser may be replaced by a compact high - power laser diode , emitting at 520 nm with a CW output power of , e.g. 900 mW 36,37 . Under pulsed operation , these diodes could provide pump - pulse energies typically ranging from 120 to 130 nJ , which is still above the lasing threshold from 30 to 40 nJ of the current devices . Moreover , the repetition rates can be greatly increased to , e.g. to 1 kHz , such that the system could be operated at~10 times higher optical powers and hence greatly improved signal - to - noise power ratios ( SNRs ) . Note that a repetition rate of 1 kHz is still low enough to allow for relaxation of excited triplet - state dye molecules with typical lifetimes on the order of tens of microseconds 38 between subsequent pulses . It should also be noted that the design of the laser cavity and the pumping scheme could be further optimized , thereby offering even higher output powers and lower thresholds , which might eventually be compatible with pump - power levels offered by light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . On the receiver side , signal read - out and data analysis may rely on compact highly sensitive cameras for visible wavelengths and on compact powerful processors , both of which are readily available on the market .",

Compared to pCMVluc , the remarkable effect on the luciferase gene observed in Figure 1 with p3NF - luc-3NF may be likely due to a larger number of pDNA copies imported into the nucleus .   This could imply that the weakness of the TATA - like promoter in p3NF - luc-3NF was counterbalanced by the higher number of pDNA copies in the nucleus . The cell fluorescence associated with pTAL - luc was a third ( with LPEI ) to a fifth ( with HIS ) less than that with p3NF - luc-3NF , suggesting that pTAL - luc polyplexes were slightly less taken up by the cells . Nevertheless , this uptake difference can not explain the 1300 - fold higher luciferase activity observed with p3NF - luc-3NF compared to pTALluc ( Figure 1 ) . This could be consecutive to an enhancement of the 3NF - plasmids penetration in the nucleus . Similar results were obtained with C2C12 cells except that the cell - associated fluorescence was 2 - to 3 - fold higher than with HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .",

Using the S - O - R framework , this study reveals the detrimental effect of COVID-19 information overload on social media that resulted in Gen Z social media users ' psychological ill - beingsocial media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 . Both social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 motivated Gen Z to disengage from social media and translated perceived information overload into social media users ' discontinuance intention . However , as social media is considered the main means by which members of Gen Z maintained contact with each other during the lockdown , FoMO was seen to buffer the impact of social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 on Gen Z 's social media discontinuance intention . Our research provides unique and original evidence demonstrating the psychological mechanism associated with Gen Z 's social media use during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and advances understanding of the ' side effects ' of COVID-19 from social and psychological perspectives . We also highlight a series of practical implications for social media users , social media platform providers , and health officials , institutions , and organizations to consider in using social media in a more effective and sustainable manner during a global pandemic and in the post - pandemic time . The present study has several limitations , such as utilizing cross - sectional data and focusing on one age group and one country during the initial pandemic phase . However , in light of the continuing pandemic , such limitations also have important implications for avenues of future work .",

    "text": "Let us briefly recall what local data of gerbes , isomorphisms and 2 - isomorphisms are , for the details we refer the reader to [ 18 ] . For a given gerbe G over M , one can choose a sufficiently \" good \" open cover O of M that permits to extract a cocycle c ∈ A 2 ( O ) , D 2 c = 0 , in a certain way . Suppose that two gerbes G 1 and G 2 are given , and O 1 and O 2 are open covers that permit to extract cocycles c 1 and c 2 . Suppose further that A : G 1 → G 2 is an isomorphism . Then one can choose a common refinement O of O 1 and O 2 that permits to extract a cochain b ∈ A 1 ( O ) such that c 2 = c 1 + D 1 b. The cochains for isomorphisms add under the composition of these isomorphisms . Finally , if a 2isomorphism ϕ : A 1 ⇒ A 2 is given and b 1 and b 2 are cochains for A 1 and A 2 , respectively , for a suitable open cover O , one can always extract a cochain a ∈ A 0 ( O ) such that b 2 = b 1 + D 0 a. The cochains for 2 - isomorphisms add under both the horizontal and the vertical composition of 2 - isomorphisms . Conversely , one can reconstruct gerbes , isomorphisms and 2 - isomorphisms from given local data , and the two procedures are inverse to each other in an appropriate sense . In particular , they establish a bijection between H 2 ( M , D(2 ) ) and the set of isomorphism classes of gerbes over M .",

    "text": "Finally , we need to know for whom commitment contracts are most likely to be acceptable , efficacious , effective , and cost effective . In other words , what characteristics of people make them particularly likely to take up a contract and use it to achieve behaviour change , and how might consumer detailing be used to augment contracts ' effectiveness and cost effectiveness ? We might expect that people most willing to accept commitment contracts are those who recognise their difficulties with resisting temptations and who are motivated to change this . People for whom commitment contracts have the greatest incremental efficacy may be those with particularly high levels of impulsivity . 2 However , getting such people to accept the contracts may be a particular challenge . If we can identify people in whom commitment contracts are more effective , programmes could be targeted at these groups . Such data might also suggest ways to broaden the acceptability and efficacy of commitment contracts , perhaps through interventions that help people link present behaviours to future consequences . 11",

    "text": "Analysts were asked to run linear regression on AFB and a transformed AFS variable . Since age at first sexual intercourse tends to have a markedly non - normal distribution ( see Fig S1 ) , we asked the analyst for a within - sex inverse rank normal transformation before running statistical models . Analysts were asked to include birth year of the respondent ( represented by birth year -1900/10 ) , its square and cubic to control for non - linear birth cohort effects . For those with family - based data , we suggested controlling for non - independence of family members or only include one family member in the analyses . We furthermore asked studies with family data to run a pooled GWAS on both sexes . Combined analyses that included both men and women also needed to include interactions of birth year and its polynomials with sex . In general , we asked to include top principal components to control for population stratification and cohort specific covariates if appropriate . Some cohorts only used birth year and not its polynomials because of multi - collinearity issues / convergence of the GWA analysis . Omission of these nonlinear birth year effects is unlikely to lead to biased inferences , since genotypes are not usually considered to be truly associated with birth year . However , inferences might be less accurate ( i.e. , have larger standard errors ) , since omission of nonlinear birth year effects can lead to larger residual variation .",

    "text": "Other genes identified by the network analysis have been previously linked to OA , but have not been studied for their potential as biomarkers / therapeutic targets . For example , Apolipoprotein D ( APOD ) was found to be downregulated in every zone of the OA cartilage . It was also 1 of the 207 mRNAs identified as significantly dysregulated from the meta - analysis and was the top - ranked gene of the MI network . Research has previously implicated APOD as being an important gene in OA pathogenesis . For example , APOD is strongly upregulated by retinoic acid [ 27 ] , which is in turn regulated by ALDH1A2 - an OA risk locus [ 28 ] . In vitro studies have shown APOD to be upregulated upon SOX9 overexpression , a master transcription factor essential for cartilage ECM formation [ 29 ] . Furthermore , a recent study into the identification of knee OA genes shared by both cartilage and synovial tissue proposed that APOD may manage OA through chondrogenesis in articular cartilage and immune regulation in the synovium [ 30 ] . The high ranking of APOD in the MI network makes it an interesting candidate for future studies into OA . In particular , research should investigate its potential as a biomarker / drug target . Fibrillin-1 ( FBN1 ) was another gene that was discovered from analysis of the MI network whose encoded protein was also found to be upregulated in the middle and deep zones of OA cartilage according to the MS data . This is particularly interesting as FBN1 is the causative gene of the inherited connective tissue disorder Marfan syndrome [ 31 ] . Moreover , it was 1 of 300 proteins identified via lectin - affinity chromatography in a previous study investigating the proteome of human OA synovial fluid [ 32 ] . The fact that this gene encodes microfibrils that play a structural role in all connective tissues , and mutations in which are known to cause a disease of the musculoskeletal system , warrants further investigation of its role in OA .",

    "text": "demonstrated enhanced signal and optical gain compared to a communication link directly using a blue LED 20 . However , in their work , low absorption was observed in the UV wavelength region , which restricted the application of their material to a UV - based communication link . We envisage that the achieved data rates can be further improved by using a more complex modulation scheme ( e.g. , orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ) , preequalisation , bit loading and power allocation . Moreover , with the improvement in the modulation bandwidth of the solar - blind UVC LED and realisation of the UVC LD , a higher modulation bandwidth of up to hundreds of megahertz can be expected in the near future .    b Bit - error rate ( BER ) of data transmission at different data rates without a CsPbBr 3 perovskite NC layer and a 500 - nm long - pass filter .

The insets show the corresponding eye diagrams . c BER of data transmission at different data rates with the colour - converting CsPbBr 3 perovskite NC layer and UV light filtered by a 500 - nm long - pass filter . The insets show the corresponding eye diagrams modulation bandwidth of the CsPbBr 3 perovskite NC layer is lower than that in the prior work by Dursun et al . 2 , the PLQY in the present work is significantly higher by approximately 30 % when the NCs are drop - cast in the form of a thin film , and thus , a higher photon conversion efficiency is exhibited that can improve photodetection . Moreover , the lower modulation bandwidth in the present work compared to prior work could be attributed to the competing band states and dynamics of recombination mechanisms in the CsPbBr 3 perovskite NCs 45,46 . However , thorough investigations are still required to understand the mechanisms so that one can potentially manipulate the recombination dynamics favourable for the design of perovskite - based optoelectronic devices in the future . Compared to other prior works , our study highlighted the superior performance of the CsPbBr 3 perovskite NC layer with a high - PLQY and a fast - PL decay time for a novel receiver design and potential monolithic integration with a Si - based receiver in a UVbased communication link .",

    "text": "To further narrow the rRNA region and the number of proteins implicated in SrmB binding , the purified SrmB - TAP complex was mildly digested with RNase A. This treatment should remove all rRNA regions that are not protected by SrmB , and all proteins that bind to these regions but do not interact directly with SrmB. The digested product was then re - purified on the calmodulin column ( SrmB retains the CBP after TAP purification ) , and analyzed for its RNA and protein content . Whatever the RNase A concentration in the range 0.05 - 0.5 mg / ml , the $ 0.5 - kb RNA fragment was converted into a $ 0.2 - kb fragment ( Figure 2A ) . After purification by urea - PAGE , this fragment was probed on a northern blot with oligonucleotide probes complementary to different regions of domain I ( Figure 2D ) . An in vitro transcript encompassing domain I was run in parallel as a control . Whereas the $ 0.2 - kb species hybridized with probes b ( 192 - 214 nt ) , c ( 240 - 259 nt ) and d ( 312 - 331 nt ) , no signal was detected with probes a ( 128 - 147 nt ) and e ( 409 - 428 nt ) ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , the $ 0.2 - kb product corresponds to the central region of domain I. Using oligonucleotide c for primer extension , its 5 0 extremity was mapped to nucleotide 198 ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the fragment spans nt 198 to $ 400 of 23S rRNA . To further confirm this localization with a different technique , the $ 0.2 - kb product was labeled at its 5 0 -end and partially digested with RNase T1 , as above . The profile of the digest unambiguously matched the succession of Gs in the central region of domain I. This is illustrated on Figure 2C , where a part of the gel is aligned with the 23S sequence from G263 to G291 . The protein composition of the partially digested SrmB complex showed that , compared with the undigested control , the number and amount of minor proteins were greatly reduced , resulting in a complex containing essentially SrmB , L4 and L24 ( compare lanes ' À'and ' + ' on Figure 2E ) . In particular , band 2 was no longer detected . Mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the r - proteins . Of note , the binding sites for L4 and L24 both lie within the 0.2 - kb RNA fragment [ ( 16 ) ; Figure 2D ] , and they are in close proximity in the 3D - structure of the ribosome ( Figure 2F ) .",

    "text": "We did not find any obvious relationship between our measured coronal loop magnetic field strengths and the magnitude of the photospheric magnetic flux of the active regions in this survey . We performed some preliminary checks , however , to investigate whether we could uncover any obvious correlations with other properties of the loops . Excluding the loop segment where the measured field strength was too high for the weak field approximation to be valid , we found a strong correlation ( r=0.66 ) with the measured temperature , such that higher magnetic field strengths lead to higher loop     were made around the loop , although our sample does cover quite a wide range of loop properties from cooler , denser cases to hotter , more tenuous ones . We also found that a relationship can be established with the loop pressure that extends to the loop segment with the highest field strength ( shown in Figure 4 ) . This segment also has the highest density and lowest temperature , which act to offset each other and allow the loop to follow the same trend as the others and the correlation between the parameters is also strong ( r=0.68 ) . Our initial survey has been limited by the need to select a sample from data taken early in the mission when calibration degradation was minimal . Ongoing progress in improving the EIS calibration will allow a wider study to take advantage of more extensive data ( including flare data ) in the future . This should help to clarify these relationships further . Landi et al . ( 2020 ) estimate the uncertainty in their measurements to be on the order of 70 % -driven by multiple factors such as the cross - calibration between the short - and longwavelength detectors , the density diagnostic ratio , atomic physics parameters , and also the accuracy of the energy separation between the 4 D 5/2 and 4 D 7/2 levels . This includes an estimate of the contribution from the radiometric calibration and sensitivity degradation over time . As discussed , we chose observations from early in the mission to minimize the impact of the time - dependence of the calibration . Based on the Warren et al . ( 2014 ) model , sensitivity loss is minimal ( < 10 % ) for the datasets we use , so this contribution is reduced from 50 % to 24 % . This propagates through to produce an uncertainty in I M IT /I M 2 of 51 % . We adopt this value in Table 1 . Furthermore , the conversion from I M IT /I M 2 to B is not linear ( see Figure 2 ) . To assess the impact of the uncertainties on this conversion , for each loop , we performed a 10000 run Monte - Carlo simulation where we randomly perturbed the I M IT /I M 2 value within a uniform distribution covering the range defined by the 51 % uncertainty . We then take the standard deviation of the magnetic field strength distribution , with the estimated ∼20 % uncertainty in the 4 D 5/2 and 4 D 7/2 energy separation added in quadrature , as our evaluation of the uncertainty in B. These range from 20 - 36 % and are added in Table 1 .",

Taken together , these results clearly demonstrate that RbCas12a requires a PAM defined as 5′-YYN for cleavage , at least in a pure in vitro system . It should be noted that 5′-ССV and 5′-СTW ( where V represents C , A , or G ; and W represents A or T ) were not able to cleave DNA templates with efficiencies of more than 25 % under the conditions of the experiment .   Recently , we demonstrated that the cleavage activity of at least three V - A nucleases ( AsCas12 , LbCas12a , and FnCas12a ) persists after a substantial reduction in the crRNA scaffold length , up to its complete removal , at high concentrations of crRNA . Furthermore , we showed that the trans - addition of a 20 - base scaffold RNA rescued the cleavage activity of these enzymes . Thus , we proposed the concept of split crRNA , which , in a complex with V - A nucleases , was comparable to cleavage activity observed with full - sized crRNA [ 17 ] . Here , we expand our observations and investigate the ability of RbCas12 to be programed with split crRNAs . As shown in Figure 6A , in reactions containing both full - sized and split crRNAs , the target DNA was cleaved by~90 % under the conditions of the experiment . We previously showed that increasing the spacer - only crRNA concentration could increase the cleavage efficacy of AsCas12a [ 17 ] . The data presented in Figure 6B demonstrate that increasing the concentration of spacer RNA from 0.5 to 5 µM causes dose - dependent DNA substrate cleavage by RbCas12a . It is possible to cleave the DNA template reasonably efficiently ( ~50 % after a 20 - min incubation ) at a protein : RNA ratio of more than 1:500 . Efficient cleavage of cognate targets was also observed when split crRNAs with unrelated spacer sequences were tested ( Figure S2 ) .",

We cultured P. falciparum for 36 - 48 h in vitro directly after blood draw from rapid diagnostic test positive ( RDT + ) samples of asymptomatic individuals at three time points of the dry season ( January , March and May ) and from samples of children presenting with their first clinical malaria episode of the ensuing transmission season ( MAL ) . By flow cytometry , we measured the increase in parasitemia and parasite development at 0 , 16 However , the number of hours in culture needed to increase parasitemia was shorter in the dry season samples than in samples from malaria - causing parasites in the transmission season ( Fig . 5a ) . In accordance with an earlier increase in parasitemia in vitro during the dry season , we could frequently identify on Giemsa smears mature schizonts after 16 and 24 h of culture and young ring stages after 30 or 36 h in the dry season samples , whereas mature schizonts of malaria - causing parasite samples were mostly observed after 36 h in culture , and young ring stages were largely found after 48 h in vitro ( Fig . 5b ) . When we calculated the number of hours in culture at which the highest increase of parasitemia could be detected for each sample , we observed that it decreased from the beginning to the end of the dry season - January , 26   in the wet season ( Fig . 5d ) . Finding later developmental parasite stages at earlier times in this short - term in vitro experiment during the dry season could indicate a faster than 48 - h intraerythrocytic replicative cycle , or , alternatively , that dry season parasites circulate longer without adhering to the host vascular endothelium and were more developed than circulating parasites in clinical malaria cases at the time of the blood draw . To test the latter , we used the RNA - seq data described in Fig . 4 to estimate , with a likelihood - based statistical method previously described 28 , the age in hours post - invasion ( hpi ) of circulating parasites from subclinical children at the end of the dry season ( May ) and from clinical cases during the wet season ( MAL ) . We determined that parasites circulating in the dry season had a transcriptional signature of ~17 hpi , 95%CI ( 14.05 , 20.8 ) , whereas parasites circulating in malaria cases during the wet season had a transcription profile similar to parasites with ~7 hpi , 95 % CI ( 6.5 , 7.7 ) ( Fig . 5e ) . Accordingly , imaging the thick blood films made in the field at the time of the blood draw , we confirmed that the more developed trophozoite stages of P. falciparum were present on subclinical samples collected at the end dry season , whereas clinical malaria samples in the transmission season presented much smaller ring stages of P. falciparum ( Fig . 5f , g ) . All together , these data show that , at the end of the dry season , P. falciparum can be found circulating at later stages of the ~48 - h asexual cycle than what is seen during clinical malaria cases in the wet season .",

    "text": "Despite the formation of a structurally appropriate neoartery the TE50 graft dilation and pulsatility data gathered over 8 months indicated a potential mismatch between the mechanical properties of the native artery and the regenerating graft . Dilation is known to reduce blood flow velocity and generate turbulence , which may limit the durability of the TE50 graft and should be prevented in future studies . This dilation of TE50 could be limited either by chemically modifying PGS [ 7b ] to slow graft degradation or by reinforcing the graft through the addition of an outer sheath layer made from materials previously reported to facilitate collagen production . [ 7c ] The mouse AA and neoarteries regenerated from TE50 grafts comprised similar fractions of elastin and SMCs , as well as a typical endothelium layer , but significantly lower amounts of collagen . It is likely that limited generation of collagen in the graft adventitia was the main contributing factor to graft dilation over time , with the loss of mechanical strength due to the rapid degradation of the original graft not compensated for by adequate collagen deposition . The dilation that the TE50 grafts experienced differs from that seen in aortic aneurysm , which is associated with an increase in collagen content as a response to selective elastin degradation . [ 36 ] Here EL generation occurred at an early stage , but limited collagen regeneration compromised the graft and led to early dilation . This indicates that early and balanced production of both organized elastin and collagen is required for the formation of a mechanically viable neoartery . Various groups have reported the generation of appropriate collagen types and amounts within their vascular graft prototypes and similar strategies could be adopted to improve the TE50 graft . [ 7b , c,22,37 ] The de novo production of organized EL in the intima - media has been identified as the missing element in biodegradable vascular graft regeneration . [ 5,7a ] Most elastogenesis is classically restricted to late fetal and early neonatal periods , [ 38 ] with limited elastin synthesis in adulthood that is in response to the loss of elastin due to injury or disease . [ 39 ] In blood vessels , elastin is an extremely durable insoluble protein and mature elastic fibers generally persist for the lifespan . [ 40 ] Adv . Mater . 2022 , 34 , 2205614 Figure 8 . Proposed remodeling of TE50 . After implantation , the non - porous TE50 vascular graft allows migration of arterial smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) from adjacent tissue to form intima - media with a circumferential aligned and layered structure . TE is gradually released from the graft . Amorphous elastin and elastin fibers are produced and assembled to form elastic lamellae , possibly with the help of M2 macrophages . The internal elastic lamellae are formed at a later stage through the joined effort of SMCs and endothelial cells . The outer surface encounters both phagocytosis activities from M1 macrophages as well as the deposition and remodeling of collagen fibrils by an interplay of arterial SMCs , fibroblasts , pericytes , and M2 macrophages to form adventitia . Upon complete degradation of TE50 , the adventitia meets intima - media to form the neoartery with spatial and microstructural features that resemble the native artery .",

A yeast three hybrid analysis identified 31 HSV-1 sense RNAs , mapping to 28 different open reading frames , which interacted specifically with ICP27 in vivo ( 26 ) . ICP27 was also found to specifically associate with seven HSV-1 RNAs in in vivo UV - crosslinking studies . The late RNA for the glycoprotein C ( gC ) gene was one of the RNAs that UV - cross - linked to ICP27 in infected cells ( 3 ) . To further refine the pools of possible RNA binding sequences , a yeast three - hybrid screen was performed with an RNA library generated from nucleotides 95 155 - 98 129 of the KOS HSV-1 genome , which encompasses two late genes , UL43 and UL44 ( gC ) . Sequences corresponding to both the mRNA coding and noncoding strands from UL43 and gC were identified in the yeast three hybrid screen as interacting with ICP27 ( data not shown ) . No obvious consensus sequences were identified in these sequences ; consequently EMSA was used to screen these sequences for those that bound to ICP27 with high affinity . A 294 - nt region of gC , corresponding to nucleotides 96 946 - 97 239 of the coding strand of the KOS HSV-1 gC mRNA , was chosen as an EMSA binding substrate . This region of the gC mRNA was chosen over the other sequences because it was within the coding region of the gC mRNA and was small enough to screen . Nineteen overlapping 30 - mer DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to coding strand of the gC RNA were used in EMSA experiments ( Figure 1C ) . RGG box motifs in other proteins recognize both RNA and DNA quadruplex structures ( 30,31 ) , so gC DNA was used instead of gC RNA for this initial screening to provide a more stable substrate for analysis . The ICP27 N - terminus was incubated with individual radiolabeled gC DNA 30mers at 37 C and resolved by nondenaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis . Figure 2A shows a gC DNA sequence that the ICP27 N - terminus was able to shift its migration to a more slowly migrating band , gC 11 - 40 , and a second sequence , gC 31 - 60 , whose migration was not affected by addition of protein . Some sequences ' migration were moderately affected ( Figure 2B ; 121 - 150 ) , whereas most gC sequences were shifted well by the ICP27 N - terminus ( Figure 2B ; gC 1 - 30 , 91 - 120 and Figure 2C ; 61 - 90 . ) Of the gC DNA oligonucleotides tested , fourteen were shifted , two were shifted moderately and three showed no discernable shift ( Table 1 ) .",

    "text": "One function of p63 is the regulation of developmental processes . Several mutations in the p63 DNA - binding domain are responsible for a family of human syndromes characterized by a combination of ectrodactyly , ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefting ( 37)(38)(39)58 ) . These observations led us to test the influence of disease - related p63 mutants on transcriptional activation of S100A2 . In reporter assays , we found an even stronger transcriptional activation employing two TAp63 g mutants derived from SHFM patients compared to wild - type p63 ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast , three p63 mutants responsible for the EEC syndrome had essentially lost their activation potential on the S100A2 promoter . A TAp63 g mutant related to the ADULT syndrome yielded some residual S100A2 activation when compared to wild - type TAp63 g ( Figure 5 ) . Interestingly , these observations correlate with severity of the epidermal syndrome phenotype since SHFM patients , in contrast to patients suffering from EEC and ADULT syndromes , are characterized by a lack of epidermal dysplasia ( 62 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the ability of p63 to stimulate expression of S100A2 plays a role in developing the phenotype of these patients . Further research is required to establish a stronger link . S100A2 was identified as a potential tumor suppressor by subtractive hybridization between normal and tumorderived mammary epithelial cells in man ( 14 ) . Consistent with these findings S100A2 expression is markedly downregulated in several tumor tissues ( 15)(16)(17)(18 ) . However , it was shown that S100A2 expression is increased in other tumors ( 21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26 ) . It was discussed that overexpression is an early event in tumorigenesis . Furthermore , a physical interaction between S100A2 and p53 proteins enhances transcriptional activity of p53 which implies antitumorigenic properties of S100A2 ( 27 ) . A possible interaction also between p63 and S100A2 proteins has not yet been investigated . Recently , it was demonstrated that S100A2 expression is able to diminish expression of Cox-2 protein which provides further evidence for a tumor suppressive function of S100A2 ( 28 ) . Interestingly , in line with these observations we showed that expression of S100A2 increases following DNA damage ( Figure 6A and C ) . The enhanced expression of S100A2 correlates with binding of p63 g protein to the S100A2 promoter ( Figure 6D ) . Generally , detection of different p63 isoforms on the mRNA and protein levels is difficult . It is possible to differentiate between TAp63 and ÁNp63 mRNA variants . On the protein level we were able to observe p63 g versus total p63 protein expression . After DNA damage we exclusively find an increase in the TAp63 isoforms on the mRNA level . Combining these observations with the data from the ChIP assays suggests that TAp63 g is induced after DNA damage and subsequent binding to the S100A2 promoter mediates its regulation ( Figure 6D ) . Supportive of this notion is the finding that p53 - negative Hep3B cells also show an increase in transcription of S100A2 together with enhanced expression of the TAp63 isoforms after DNA damage is observed ( Figure 6C ) . In conclusion , it is possible that regulation of S100A2 transcription by TAp63 g is a supporting mechanism to complement and enhance cellular response in preventing tumor transformation ( 34 ) . This is consistent with earlier observations implying that TAp63 g is able to substitute partially p53 function in hepatocellular carcinomas lacking p53 expression by transactivating the maspin tumor suppressor ( 55 ) .",

[ 3,9 ] , we determine the uncertainty range of x s + by the 90 % confidence criteria on the dimuon production data sets . This range is 0.018 < x s + < 0.040 . The two sets of PDFs that represent the best fits corresponding to the lower ( upper ) bound value of x s + will be referred to as CTEQ6.5S1 ( CTEQ6.5S2 ) . The variation of x s + 8 The parton number integral is strongly correlated with the normalization of the ν andν dimuon production data sets compared to the theoretically calculated inclusive charm production cross section . There are various sources of uncertainty on this overall factor : experimental ( global and energydependent ) normalization of the total cross sections ( ∼ 2 − 5 % ) , fragmentation function of charm quark to charmed hadrons , branching ratio of charmed hadron decay to muon ( ∼ 10 % ) , . . . , etc . These are taken into account according to our standard uncertainty analysis . The limits of x s + obtained above correspond to ±20 % ovreall variation of the normalization factor , as determined by this analysis procedure . As the magnitude of x s + varies , the shape of s + ( x ) also adjusts to best fit the global data . A plot of s + ( x ) for these PDFs will be shown in the next section .",

    "text": "It is worth noting that the presence of the SARS - CoV-2 has also been demonstrated in the urine of SARS - CoV-2 infected patients ( Holshue et al . , 2020;Wang et al . , 2020b;Wang et al . , 2020c ) . The virus was more stable in urine than in the stool . The infectious virus was detectable for up to 3 days in the urine of two adult COVID-19 patients and after 4 days in the urine of one child . In turn , the SARS - CoV-1 retained infectivity in a urine sample for 5 ( 21 - 25 ° C ) ( Duan et al . , 2003 ) to 17 days ( 20 ° C ) ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . None of these studies reported a period of complete virus inactivation . More and more authors show the presence of SARS - CoV-2 in urine , but the incidence of this phenomenon is low , and its significance from a clinical point of view is probably low ( Peng et al . , 2020;Liu et al . , 2020aLiu et al . , , 2020bYoon et al . , 2020 ) . The presence of the virus in the urine is not necessarily an indicator of infectious particles in this material . The infectivity of the viral particles can be assessed using in vitro tests on cell culture ( Sun et al . , 2020;Zhang et al . , 2020d;Wang et al . , 2020c;Xiao et al . , 2020b ) . Sun et al . ( 2020 ) showed that the urine sample was for the first time positive for SARS - CoV-2 RNA on day 12 postinfection ( p.i . ) and had periodically showed positive results in RT - PCR test until 42 days . They observed cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells for the 12 p.i . specimen after three days ( Sun et al . , 2020 ) . Table 4 presents data on SARS - CoV-1 and SARS - CoV-2 in urine and stool . The knowledge of the stability of SARS - CoV viruses in human excretions is of great importance as it allows to predict their role as a source of virus particles .",

We hypothesize that wastewater surveillance programs provide an effective alternative for detecting emerging variants and assessing COVID-19 incidence , particularly when clinical surveillance is limited . Here , we analyzed SARS - CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from eight locations across Southern Nevada between March 2020 and April 2021 . Trends in SARS - CoV-2 RNA concentrations ( ranging from 4.3 log 10 gc / L to 8.7 log 10 gc / L ) matched trends in confirmed COVID-19 incidence , but wastewater surveillance also highlighted several limitations with the clinical data . Amplicon - based whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) of 86 wastewater samples identified the B.1.1.7 ( Alpha ) and B.1.429 ( Epsilon ) lineages in December 2020 , but clinical sequencing failed to identify the variants until January 2021 , thereby demonstrating that ' pooled ' wastewater samples can sometimes expedite variant detection . Also , by calibrating fecal shedding ( 11.4 log 10 gc / infection ) and wastewater surveillance data to reported seroprevalence , we estimate that~38 % of individuals in Southern Nevada had been infected by SARS - CoV-2 as of April 2021 , which is significantly higher than the 10 % of individuals confirmed through clinical testing .

    "text": "Compared with increasing coverage , partner notification identifies more chlamydia positive individuals for each unit of resource invested in a screening programme . There is considerable scope to improve partner notification outcomes . Furthermore , reallocation of resources to ensure provision and monitoring of effective partner notification is likely to result in substantial cost savings in comparison with increasing screening coverage only . It is not clear from the available data how much additional benefit should be expected from a given level of investment in partner notification . The wide range of reported partner notification and the diverse methods of organisation make it difficult to generalise , and urgent evaluation is needed to establish the most cost effective approach to partner notification . Equitable access to screening for men and women should continue to be promoted . However , the additional resources required to increase male screening coverage to reach equity with females would be more effectively employed in the short term in achieving high partner notification efficacy among those who test positive . Partner notification therefore mitigates the impact of sex inequity in screening coverage since the high proportion of partners infected offsets the lower number of men screened Performance indicators must reflect quality and value for money of service provision , not just quantity of services provided . The spreadsheet tool we have developed will enable local services to evaluate their own programmes and allow rapid updates based on national reports . This tool could also be adapted for use in other countries . We provide strong evidence for the cost effectiveness of partner notification in identifying infected cases compared with screening alone . The number of infected individuals ( women and men ) identified through a screening programme is arguably a more appropriate metric for assessing the success of screening than primary coverage by sex .",

    "text": "In the following , we describe the development and validation of our approach step by step . Since we did not want to impose assumptions about what elements of movement of the body were more important , we simply collected movement data from the whole body and later used the data to find what was best suited for characterizing the disease , thereby avoiding observer bias . We used a wearable sensor ' suit ' ( a set of wristwatch - sized ( 4.7 × 3.0 × 1.3 cm ) sensors attached with Velcro to the body or clothing of the individuals ) that allowed us to capture the motion trajectory of all limbs and the body - from foot to hip , from hand to shoulder and from hip to head at a temporal resolution of 60 Hz . In the first step , we compared the joint kinematics of ADLs between healthy controls and patients with DMD and already found significant distinguishing elements : the distribution of joint angles across almost all body joints showed differences between DMD and controls ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . These quantitative differences are consistent with the qualitative descriptions of DMD in several ways . First , by inspecting the histograms of skeletal joint movement throughout ADLs ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 1 for all major joints ) we saw reflection of hyperlordosis in the DMD posture : the right shifted distribution of the angles subtended by the hip joint with respect to healthy controls and correspondingly a stronger flexion ( left shift of the distribution ) of the knee joint . Similarly , the overall stiffer posture in DMD upper - body poses is reflected by the more contracted distribution of the DMD elbow joint angles compared to healthy controls . Second , the characteristic DMD Trendelenburg sign ( waddling gait ) is reflected in the joint angular velocity correlation matrix of ADLs ( Fig . 1c ) where across the lower extremities we saw less anticorrelation between joints moving in the sagittal plane ( knee and hip flexion ) and more correlation in the coronal plane ( sideways abduction of the hips ) that reflect waddling .",

    "text": "Recovering positive examples for data that mixes disjoint sparsity with popularity - based positive structure For our final synthetic experiment , we construct a scenario that combines aspects of our two previous experiments . In this experiment , we consider three disjoint groups . For each disjoint group we use a categorical distribution with nonuniform event probabilities for sampling items within baskets , which induces a positive correlation structure within each group . Therefore , the oracle will expect to see a high negative correlation for disjoint pairs , compared to all other non - disjoint pairs within a particular disjoint group . For items with a high co - occurrence probability , we expect the symmetric DPP to recover a near zero negative correlation , and the nonsymmetric DPP to recover a positive correlation . Furthermore , we expect both the nonsymmetric and symmetric models to recover higher marginal probabilities , or K ii values , for more popular items . The determinantal volumes for positive pairs containing popular items will thus tend to be larger than the volumes of negative pairs . Therefore , for baskets containing popular items , we expect that both the nonsymmetric   for high - sparsity data . 14 disjoint groups are used for data generation . and symmetric models will be able to easily discriminate between positive and negative baskets . When constructing positive baskets , popular items are sampled with high probability , proportional to their popularity . We therefore expect that both models will be able to recover some signal about the correlation structure of the data within each disjoint group , resulting in a predictive AUC higher than 0.5 , since the popularity - based positive correlation structure within each group allows the model to recover some structure about correlations among item pairs within each group . However , we expect that the nonsymmetric model will provide better predictive performance than the symmetric model , since its properties enable recovery of disjoint structure ( as discussed previously ) . We see the expected results in Figure 3 , which are further confirmed by the predictive AUC results : 0.7 for the symmetric model , and 0.75 for the nonsymmetric model .",

Excess RapA was previously shown to produce complex effects on in vitro transcription , which included inhibitory effects at ' early ' timepoints and a significant increase in the number of completed transcriptional rounds in prolonged in vitro transcription reactions , which was attributed to RapAs remodeling of DNA - RNA polymerase - RNA ternary complexes ( 23 ) . In this study - given that the interaction of RapA with the polymerase is well established - using primarily purified native RapA ( 21 ) at a ' physiological ' ( 1:1 ) molar ratio with the polymerase , we have conducted experiments in order to clarify the general mechanistic aspects of this remodeling . Our work presents multiple , independent lines of evidence indicating that RNA is a key substrate of RapA. Our biochemical data , supported by a homology model of the RapA NTPase domain - DNA complex , suggest that this RNA - remodeling activity of RapA may be in addition to its DNA - binding activity . Our results are consistent with a model in which RapA promotes RNA release from DNA - RNA polymerase - RNA ternary complexes . Taken together , our data indicate a novel RNA remodeling activity for RapA , a representative of the SWI / SNF protein superfamily . This finding could potentially deepen our understanding of the functions of all SWI / SNF proteins , and may point to yetunidentified activities of eukaryotic SWI / SNF proteins .",

When the beam waist is smaller than 2 μm ( not shown in the figure ) , the axial force changes along the axial direction from negative to positive at all longitudinal sections ( planes parallel to the beam axis ) , which forms the laser tweezers mode . 22 Working in this mode , the laser beam traps the cells around its focal point rather than guiding the cells to move along the beam axis . Because rapid relative motion between the trapped particle and the laser beam is always actively created in the laser patterning procedure , a large radial trapping range is required to provide sufficient trapping force even when the trapped particle is away from the optimal trapping region during laser beam navigation . Our laser cell micropatterning experiment , in which a cell in cell suspension was trapped and guided by the focused laser beam in the cell deposition chamber , was consistent with the simulated results . The experiment showed that the limited trapping range in the laser tweezers mode did not allow the trapped cell to follow the rapid 3D movement of the laser beam during high - speed patterning navigation in a large volume of cell culture medium with strong convectional flow . When the beam waist was as large as 4 μm , the axial optical force remains positive along the axial direction in all longitudinal sections ( Figure 3c ) , forming the pure - guidance mode . In this particular mode , the radial force was too small ( Figure 3d ) to confine the cell within the beam axis during the patterning navigation process .",

Interpolation of a NNLM with a 4 - gram LM gives a 16.9 % reduction in perplexity over a single NNLM even though the two LMs have relatively close perplexities . We use the correlation coefficient between the posterior probabilities of the predicted word over the test set from the two models as a simple measure to predict whether the models are diverse . If the posterior probabilities are highly correlated , then the models are less diverse and smaller gains are expected from fusion . The posteriors from the N - gram and NNLM have a correlation coefficient of 0.869 which is significantly lower than the correlation coefficient of 0.988 for a pair of randomly initialized NNLMs . This higher diversity of the NNLM and N - gram LM combination results in significant perplexity improvement upon interpolation .",

    "text": "While we will herein focus on emerging and future material applications of synthetic sequence - defined macromolecules , we briefly highlight contemporary synthetic processes to sequencedefined polymers as they critically influence the building block variety and achievable chain length , which in turn dictate the resulting material properties and thus applications . The synthetic approaches toward sequence - defined macromolecules were recently summarized and can generally be divided into liquid - phase approaches , solid - phase approaches , and fluorous - phase or polymer - tethered methodologies , [ 2 ] with all their individual advantages and disadvantages . Linear synthetic approaches can install one monomer unit per iterative cycle ( Figure 2 ) , be it in a submonomer strategy or by installing the monomer completely , for instance , via single unit monomer insertion ( SUMI ) . By contrast , bidirectional growth ( Figure 2 ) commences from not only one reactive site but two , thus leading to higher degrees of polymerization more rapidly , and symmetric macromolecules . Of course , also multidirectional approaches , leading to star - shaped macromolecules , are possible . The strategy leading to the fast build - up of molecular weight is the so - called iterative exponential growth ( IEG , Figure 2 ) , often termed divergent / convergent approach , which , however , offers the least control over the obtained sequence ( i.e. , only one type of monomer is usually used ) . The latter two approaches are not well - suited for solid - phase or fluorous - phase synthesis and the linear approach offers the highest possible degree of definition . Thus , several prime examples following this linear Emerging applications of a new class of materials , sequence - defined macromolecules , are explored . Such molecularly highly defined macromolecules require stringent synthesis and purification procedures , yet offer unprecedented application possibilities . The first examples of molecular data storage and related technologies are already starting to emerge today . From a more fundamental point of view , such macromolecules offer a unique opportunity to determine quantitative structure - property relationships ( QSPR ) , which critically aids in designing materials with applications ranging from catalysis to artificial enzymes .",

    "text": "More advanced studies such as high - resolution imaging and changes in protein expression have recently shown that on different topographies or within the same , some bacteria can be impaled or deformed on nanopillars , and some exhibit an enhanced oxidative stress response , resulting in mechanically ruptured and lysed cells or not . [ 44,46 ] This multitude of scenarios suggests that either several mechanisms exist at once for some structures , or one dominates , driven by a particularity of the topography - bacterium pair ( and likely environment ) . Therefore , to elucidate the underlying mechanism , we further probe the surface by SEM imaging ( Figure 5d - f ) and discover the significantly lower number of adhered bacteria to the nanostructures than to the controls , also observing that ≈50 % of those attached cells are ruptured / lysed ( see the Experimental Section ) . Amongst the bacteria that appear intact on the nanostructures , we note they appear flattened / deformed when resting on nanopillars , yet there are no clear signs of their disintegration ( debris or cytosolic content visible ) . This can be attributed to cellular leakage ( washed away ) , loss of turgor pressure , and/or . The photopic response of the human eye is shown with light blue shaded area . c ) Measured and calculated transmission of C and DS samples as a function of incident angle for incoherent , unpolarized light , for photopic calibrated data . d ) Top : Sequential images of a droplet impacting a surface with an initial diameter D 0 = 2.7 mm , expanding to a maximum diameter D max = 9.45 mm as it spreads on the surface , followed by retraction and take - off . The corresponding plot of drop diameter versus time with the y - axis normalized to D 0 is shown for P100 ( gray ) and P400 ( pink ) at two impacting velocities : 1.0 m s −1 ( dots ) and 2.0 m s −1 ( circles ) . The average contact time < τ > of the droplet with the surface is indicated to be 13.4 ms and 17.8 ms for P100 and P400 , respectively . e ) Calculated capillary pressure P c plotted for nanocones of pitch 50 , 100 , and 200 nm , as a function of the penetration percentage ( z / h ) , where z is the depth of meniscus penetration and h is the total height . The water hammer pressure generated at impacts of 20 and 110 kph are marked on the graph , with varying values for the water hammer pressure coefficient K WH . The bottom row of schematics serves as a representation of the penetration depth z / h. stretching deformation upon adhesion ( which likely is pre-(full ) rupture provided the number of dead bacteria found by fluorescent imaging which scores viability based on the membrane integrity ) . Analysis of the average cell surface area and its distribution ( Figure 5f ; see the Experimental Section ) reveals an increase , further confirming the bacteria are flattened . Nonetheless , although made of glass , we can not exclude the role of pillar flexibility due to their fine size , evidenced in Figure S23 in the Supporting Information , to contribute to the overall performance via a recently proposed energy storage - release mechanism . [ 48 ] Overall , this demonstration of antibacterial glass indicates that at p ≈ 100 nm , S. aureus is killed with an efficiency matching the best reported structures in silicon , leading to bacteria lysis through stretch - and - rupturing and likely piercing , enhanced by the deflection of nanopillars . Further gains in performance are anticipated by adjusting the AR , however we reserve this investigation for future studies , and instead place emphasis on the potential of RSML as a fabrication tool in controllable nanoscale glass etching to achieve such functionalities .",

There was no evidence of an effect of self medication as pre - existing psychotic symptoms did not significantly predict later cannabis use . 6 Ferdinand and co - workers investigated the role of pre - existing self reported psychotic symptoms and showed a bi - directional association between cannabis and psychotic symptoms over a 14 year follow - up study in the general population . 11 They showed that cannabis use predicted later psychotic symptoms in individuals with no evidence of psychotic symptoms before starting to use cannabis and that the reverse was also true , in that psychotic symptoms predicted cannabis use in those who had not used cannabis before the onset of those symptoms . 11 A prospective population based cohort study also found evidence for a self medication effect . 14 Individuals with self reported hallucinations at the age of 14 had a higher risk of using cannabis on a daily basis at the age of 21 . In a sibling pair analysis , however , this study also suggested an independent effect of cannabis use on self reported delusional ideation later in life . 14 Thus , although the cannabis - psychosis link has been investigated in many studies , results on the temporal association between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms remain conflicting . Longitudinal cohort studies with multiple repeated interview based measures of cannabis use and psychotic symptoms are needed to clarify this issue .

    "text": "To compare our findings to observations , we extract the following characteristics from the computed spectra : ( i ) the ratio of the integrated redward over the integrated blueward flux ( L red /L blue ) -which is a measure of the asymmetry of the line shape ; ( ii ) the flux at ' draught ' between the peaks ( F valley ) in comparison to the flux at the maximum point ( F peak ) , which , in practice , quantifies the ' deepness ' of the draught of the double peaked spectra ; and ( iii ) the position of the red emission peak ( v red ) . We show the evolution of these measures in Fig . 3 from t = 40 to 100 Myr ( in intervals of 10 Myr ) with the last data point marked with a square . We compare this to observations of nearby , star - forming galaxies ( the ' Green Peas ' ; data taken from Yang et al . 2016 , also Henry et al . 2015 , and to z ∼ 2 − 3 Lyman - α selected galaxies ( Erb et al . 2014 ) . In addition , we also display other simulation results presented in Walch et al . ( 2015 ) , Gatto et al . ( 2017 ) , and Peters et al . ( 2017 ) ( shown as black circles in Fig . 3 ) . These hydrodynamical simulations include supernovae feedback with random SN positions and cover SN rates from 5 to 45 Myr −1 with none including CRs ( but partially include stellar wind and UV feedback ) . We show them only to support the case that the spectral shape we obtain for the ' noCR ' simulation is not an outlier -but in fact typical for hydrodynamical simulations containing thermal feedback . Fig . 3 shows that all the simulations without CRs produce Lyα spectra with significant flux at line center ( F valley 0.4F peak ; see also the left panel of Fig . 1 ) . This flux is reduced significantly from t 30 Myr in the CR simulations as the outflow is established . Also the asymmetry of the line is increased leading to L red /L blue ∼ 2 . Both measures are more in line with what is found in observations where mostly F valley /F peak 0.1 and L red /L blue 2.5 ( see also Steidel et al . 2010;Kulas et al . 2012 ) . Determining F valley observationally requires a high spectral resolution since the convolution of the true spectrum with the instrument 's kernel leads to a spreading of the peak flux , and thus , the true value of F valley can be even lower than measured . This effect makes our comparison of F valley /F peak conservative and the true discrepancy between the ' noCR ' simulation and the observations might be even larger .",

We first have divided the lung cancer datasets into training and test sets , and then the differential gene expression analysis has been performed on the training set using DeSeq2 [ Love et al . , 2014 ] , by which 1,000 out of the top 5,000 genes with higher log2 fold change between LUAD and LUSC have been selected for consequent analyses . We first check the subtyping accuracy by directly applying linear SVM to the raw counts in the target domain , which gives an average accuracy of 59.28 % with a sample standard deviation ( STD ) of 5.54 % from ten independent runs . We also transform the count data to standard normal data after removing the sequencing depth effect using DESeq2 [ Love et al . , 2014 ] and then apply regularized logistic regression provided by the LIBLINEAR ( https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/ ) package [ Fan et al . , 2008 ] . The classification accuracy becomes 74.10 % ± 4.41 % . Table 1 provides cancer subtyping performance comparison between BMDL , NB - HDP , HDP - NBFA , hGNBP , as well as the baseline hGNBP - NBFA using only the samples form the target domain . In only HDP based methods can not improve the results in the low - related setup , but also the performance will be degraded with more severe \" negative transfer \" adversarial effects when using more source samples . The reason for this is that HDP assumes a latent factor with higher weight in the shared DP will occur more frequently within each sample [ Williamson et al . , 2010 ] . This might be an undesirable assumption , especially when the domains are distantly related . For example , a latent factor might not be present throughout the HNSC samples but dominant within the samples of lung cancer . HDP based methods are not able to discover these latent factors given observed samples due to the limited number of lung cancer samples . In addition to this undesirable assumption , NB - HDP does not account for the sequencing - depth heterogeneity of different samples , which may lead to biased results deteriorating subtyping performance as shown in Table 1 .",

Comparison of the portable device peak T intensity and these flow cytometry data , Fig . 5 , reveal a reasonable correlation ( r 2 = 0.56 ) and certainly an improvement in comparison to the regulatory microbial measures . It is interesting to note that the error bars associated with technical repeats of flow cytometry are generally greater than those associated with the new fluorescence device . The improved correlation reflects the benefits of flow cytometry identifying all bacteria in a sample rather than the culturable bacteria only . Hoefel et al . ( 2003 ) demonstrated that HPC counts in a mix of raw and potable waters were generally 2 - 4 log fold less than the numbers of total bacteria reported using the same stains as the BacLight ™ Kit in this study .

We analyzed the sequencing data obtained from flies with an extra NLS on otherwise wild - type Blanks and found that 666 loci met the cutoff - criterion of a rescue / mutant ratio ≥5 . Overall , there was a very good agreement between the two datasets . Nonetheless , it appears that increased nuclear retention lowers the siRNA yield from more active regions while it may slightly increase the yield from the regions with lower activity ( Supplementary Figure S6A ) . The regions displayed in Figure 7C - E are examples of rather active loci and the traces reflect the reduced yield seen in the rescue with NLS - blanks . It thus appears that in particular the more abundant dsRNA precursors become trapped in the nucleus . The less abundant ones might benefit from the presumably higher nuclear concentration of NLS - Blanks , which may outweigh the negative effect of a prolonged nuclear retention . Importantly , siRNA generation was entirely dependent on the RNA binding capacity of dsRBD2 . When the corresponding data was analyzed , we found that now only 73 loci met the ratio cutoff - criterion and overall the ratios no longer correlated between a rescue with wild - type blanks protein and the rescue with the blanks variant carrying inactivating point mutations in dsRBD2 ( Supplementary Figure S6B ) .",

Compliance monitoring for the LCR do not require monitoring of schools and daycare facilities unless the school manages their own drinking water system . While the U.S. EPA does not currently require testing at schools and daycare facilities , the agency does provide guidance for reducing Pb in drinking water at these sensitive sites ( U.S. EPA , 2005 and . A recent survey conducted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO , 2018 ) found that 59 % of schools did not test , or were unsure if they tested , for Pb in tap drinking water . Of the 41 % of schools that did test for Pb in drinking water , 37 % found elevated levels . School districts varied in the threshold used for determination of elevated Pb . School districts reported using either the 15 ppb standard for compliance monitoring for public water systems , or the 20 ppb action level suggested in the 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking Water in Schools ( U.S. EPA , 2006 ) guidance document for schools and daycares , while others reported using more conservative action levels than 15 ppb . The difference in the LCR and 3Ts standards is reflective of the difference in goals . The LCR standards are intended to identify system - wide problems to inform water treatment protocols , whereas the guidance for schools and daycares are intended to identify issues with specific drinking water outlets ( U.S. EPA , 2006 ) . Identifying the extent of Pb contamination at schools and daycares is essential to understanding the exposure burden for children from their total environment . Currently there is very limited data available for levels of Pb in drinking water at schools and daycares . The availability of multi - media exposure data is even more limited for these sites . In our review , we identified Pb concentration data in soil and drinking water for a limited number of school sites . Our review did not identify data sources for dust Pb loadings at U.S. schools . Considering the substantial amount of time that children spend at these alternative locations , it is imperative that there is a better understanding of potential Pb exposure at these sites to successfully reduce Pb exposure and overall BLLs for this vulnerable population .",
