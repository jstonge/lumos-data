    "text": "comparison with other studies By contrast with most previous research , our study included women aged 15 - 49 years , most of whom will have been premenopausal . Thus , the periods of observation for ever users of hormonal contraceptives in this age group had a higher proportion of information relating to current or recent use than those for ever users in a study recruiting older women , because many would have stopped using hormonal contraception many years previously . The Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer 's reanalysis of oral contraception data from 45 studies included women who were generally older than our cohort ( mean age of diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 56 years , with only 18 % of tumours diagnosed in women younger than 45 years ) . 4 The overall relative risk between ever and never users was 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.70 to 0.76 ) . The Collaborative Group 's analysis found that younger and premenopausal women seemed to have greater percentage reductions in risk of ovarian cancer per five years of oral contraceptive use . 4 However , after accounting for time since last use , no significant heterogeneity by menopausal status or age was seen , demonstrating that how recent a woman last used hormonal contraceptives was more important than the other two factors . Our slightly stronger reduced risk for any ovarian cancer among ever users of any hormonal contraception ( relative risk 0.66 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.58 to 0.76 ) ) was possibly due to 58 % of the total period of observation in ever users arising from current or recent use of combined oral contraceptives . Similar to the Collaborative Group 4 and other more recent investigations , [ 5][6][7][8][9 ] we found that the risk reductions among current users of any hormonal contraception got stronger with longer durations of use and persisted for a number of years after stopping use . The apparent loss of protection 10 years after stopping hormonal contraception could be due to the loss of biological effect ( assuming a causal association exists ) , or reduced statistical power to continue to observe a significant reduction due to the relatively small periods of observation ( 7 % of total person years for ever use ) .",

Incubation of bronchial epithelial cells with supernatants collected over 72 h from either RV1bor PIV3 - infected cells decreased the repair process 24 h post injury . Preincubation of injured and not - injured cells with the LPS inhibitor decreased supernatant - induced repair inhibition . This effect was also seen in cultures stimulated by conditioned media from RV1b in the presence of either TRIF inhibitor or MyD88 inhibitor .

Due to its simple mechanism and convenient data collection strategy , resistive pressure sensing has been extensively applied using various recording mechanisms . [ 111 ] Bulky piezoresistive e - skins , like sponge - based sensors , rely primarily on pressure - induced changes in the number of conductive pathways [ 112 ] or in the shape of the sensing material . [ 113 ] Meanwhile , other resistive sensors may analyze the changes in the contact resistance , like the quantum tunneling effect ( Figure 4A ) . [ 114,115 ] This type is much more sensitive and thinner than the bulky option . An e - skin based on bilayer microdome arrays can use microstructures to maximize the changes in surface contact resistance based on the tunneling effect ( Figure 4B ) . [ 115 ] Nevertheless , some drawbacks , like large hysteresis , [ 116 ] large confounding temperature sensitivity , [ 117 ] and varying pressure sensitivity [ 118 ] have limited the performance of resistive sensors . Compared with resistive sensors , capacitive sensors have excellent linearity with lower power consumption . [ 119 ] For piezocapacitive e - skins , capacitance changes are mainly based on the deformation of the dielectric layer . Normal pressure and tangential strain can be measured through a capacitive sensor as the dielectric layer can be deformed under tensile and external pressure ( Figure 4C ) . As demonstrated in Figure 4D , [ 120 ] a capacitive pressure sensing array with cross - arranged electrodes was fabricated using CNTs as the electrode material and PDMS as the dielectric layer .",

An actiwatch is a small , wrist worn , device which measures movement on a minute - by - minute basis . It has been used widely within clinical sleep research as a proxy measure of sleep \/ wake ( Martin and Hakim , 2011 ) and has been shown to be suitable ( Sadeh , 2011 ) for identifying rhythms . The raw data from the actiwatch can be plotted to create a personalized actogram [ Fig . 1 ] . Each horizontal line in the actogram represents a 24 - h period ( from midnight to midnight ) . Black vertical lines represent movement , with the height of the line indicating intensity of movement . In a ' normal ' , monophasic pattern we would expect movement to be concentrated in the middle of each day with little movement to the far right and far left of each line . In Fig . 1 , which represents the total two - week period from a single participant , what is immediately of interest is ( i ) the constant and continuous movement across the 24h period and ( ii ) a lack of any clear demarcation between day \/ night movement . The actigraphy data were downloaded prior to the interviews and used during them to encourage participants to reflect on and interpret their personalized graph . The self - completion diaries ( when completed ) were also used during the interviews as prompts to recall and to help participants ' make sense ' of the actigraphy data . The actigraphs and diaries in effect acted as what Latour ( 1987 ) would call ' inscription devices ' ; encouraging a richer understanding of sleep as they provoked participants to reflect subjectively on seemingly objective measures of movement , rest and sleep .",

In fact , production systems are transitioning to cyber - physical production systems ( CPPS ) , where the virtual and physical worlds converge ( Monostori , 2014 ) and the value of data is harnessed to achieve desired goals . However , as Tao et al .

Approaches , technologies and methods are therefore needed to reconcile these two worlds and support relevant strategic goals for the manufacturing industry , sustainability included . For this to happen , \" soft aspects \" at a company or corporate scale come into play when change is introduced in a system , such as competences and capabilities . In the 1990s , management scholars Teece and Pisano ( 2003 ) noted the time dimension of competences and capabilities , as they highlighted the importance of management capability to effectively adapt to changing environments by \" re - configuring internal and external organisational skills and resources \" . These components of responsiveness and adaptation are core parts of the sustainability management field . For example , Dangelico et al .

    "text": "To further demonstrate the performance of psRNATarget in analyzing miRNA - mRNA interactions in non - Arabidopsis species , we analyzed another benchmark dataset , referred to as rice miRNA - mRNA interaction data , which was collected from the supplemental data ( the additional file 8) of the paper published by Srivastava et al . ( 8) . The new psRNATarget was able to recall much more validated miRNA - mRNA interactions without significantly increasing the total predictions when searching the same rice miRNAs in the rice miRNA - mRNA interaction data against the same rice transcript library , JGI rice Phytozome 12 genome annotation . Specifically , the recall rate was estimated at 82.7 % by the psRNATarget * The comparison was performed between 65 unique miRNAs \/ ta - siRNAs in the benchmark dataset ( Supplementary Table S1 ) and the Arabidopsis TAIR10 transcripts . Maximum expectation was set to 5.0 and the maximum number of allowed top targets for each miRNA was set to 200 for both scoring schemas . 2017 release compared with the 62.5 % recall rate by the psRNATarget 2011 release ( Table 2 ) , validating the new psRNATarget 's improved performance in analyzing both Arabidopsis and non - Arabidopsis miRNA - mRNA interactions . Using our Arabidopsis benchmark dataset , prediction performances were also compared between the new psR - NATarget and the standalone pipeline , TargetFinder ( 19 ) . Both applications delivered similar ' recall rate ' and total predictions when we chose to balance the ' recall rate ' and precision through adjusting score cutoff ( Supplementary   Table S3 ) . However , if we chose to maximize ' recall rate ' to cover more validated interactions , the new psRNATarget will recall slightly more validated interactions and report much less total predictions , which in turn indicate much higher precision ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . We further compared performances between new psRNATarget and the TAPIR ( 20 ) using its fast mode since the hybrid mode stringently restricts the size of data that can be analyzed each time due to slow computational speed of the algorithm . We noticed that ' recall rate ' of TAPIR is significantly lower than the other two applications even after we adjusted the cutoff thresholds to maximize the ' recall rate . ' However , TAPIR generated much less predictions than the psRNATarget 2017 release and TargetFinder did , indicating higher prediction precision ( Supplementary Table S3 ) .",

In response to cellular stress , the transcription factor p53 mediates the expression of genes involved in protective processes such as DNA repair , cell cycle arrest , and apoptosis . [ 343,344 ] Binding of MDM2 and MDMX to the N - terminal transactivation domain of p53 blocks this so - called \" guardian of the genome \" , either by mediating its ubiquitylation that finally leads to its degradation by the proteasome [ 345 ] or by acting as a direct antagonist . [ 346 ] An upregulation of MDM2 and MDMX has been detected in many types of cancers , thus resulting in the interaction between these proteins and p53 being prime targets for anticancer strategies . Crystal structures of the complex between MDM2 and the transactivation domain of p53 reveal an a - helical conformation of the p53 interaction domain when bound to MDM2 ( Figure 16 a ) . [ 347 ] P53 hot - spot residues involve Phe19 , Trp23 , and Leu26 . [ 347 ] This structural information together with the crystallographic data of the similarly arranged p53 - MDMX complex [ 348 ] have been used as the starting point for a rational design of the corresponding PPI inhibitors . For some peptidomimetics , helical peptides derived from phage - display selections served as alternative starting points . Examples include the phagedisplay - derived peptides pDi [ 349 ] and PMI [ 350 ] that exhibit dual inhibitory effects for both the p53 - MDM2 and p53 - MDMX complexes . This is considered a desirable feature for efficient anticancer activity . Additionally , mirror - image phage - display ( MIPD ) techniques together with native chemical ligation have provided proteolytically more - resistant d - peptide inhibitors of the p53 - MDM2 interaction . However , these peptides do not feature sufficient cell permeability . [ 351][352][353 ] Finally , although mRNA display has enabled the screening of larger libraries of peptides , [ 354 ] the proteolytic instability and\/or poor cellular uptake of these peptides remain major limitations of these approaches .",

Once again , inspection of the D RXES and D XES highlights the ability of 1s3p RXES at the pre - edge region to identify the presence of ferrous iron , which is not possible using the Kb XES spectra alone . Future studies including 1s3p RXES full planes collected with higher resolution instruments may allow for amore rigorous quantification of the changes in electronic structure , e nabling better distinction between the different intermediate states .

    "text": "We extended this approach to in vivo imaging by analyzing TSFG signals in 2 dpf zebrafish embryos submitted to artificial hypoxia . Embryos were mounted as described previously except that the observation chamber was sealed ( Fig . 4b ) . The embryo and agarose were deposited in a ≈ 100 µL well at the bottom of the microscope slide , and covered with a coverslip sealed with silicone ( twinsil speed , Picodent , Germany ) while the agarose was still liquid . Within 10 min after mounting , the imaging session started and consisted in recording a time series of 30 images every 5 min during several 2 - 5 hours . After that session , the top cover glass of the chamber was removed to recover normoxia , the dish was filled with embryo medium and placed back under the microscope with the embryo still embedded in agarose . The same region was then imaged . The time between the last hypoxia image and the first one after opening chamber was < 15 min . From the recorded images , we segmented the RBCs and extracted the average oxygenation parameter R = S 401 \/ S 433 at each time point . Figure 4b shows the time evolution of R in the case of one embryo . The values of R before , during , and after hypoxia for nine embryos is presented in Fig . 4c . We consistently observed a decrease of the R parameter during the hypoxia assay ( typically-40 % after 3 h ) , suggesting that the limited oxygen supply inside the small chamber volume was being consumed by the embryo . After chamber opening , the R parameter returned to its original value , indicating that RBCs recovered their oxygenation state within minutes after hypoxia . This fast recovery is consistent with 58 . Together , these data provide strong evidence for the possibility of label - free functional TSFG microscopy . Importantly , our implementation can probe RBCs in vivo with single - cell resolution and microsecond pixel dwell times .",

    "text": "The short Pt … Pt distance found in the solid state stimulated us to look for signs of the metalophilic Pt … Pt interaction in solution . Emission and absorption spectroscopy studies were hence undertaken at a concentration of 50 μm in methanol or in aqueous solutions . In methanol , both complexes were highly soluble , and spectroscopically speaking , comparatively highenergy absorption ( 451 nm or lower ) and emission maxima ( 604 for [ 1]OAc and 556 and 591 nm for [ 2]OAc , see Figure 2a ; Table S6 , Supporting Information ) were found , which suggested an absence of metalophilic interaction and hence monomeric species . The distinct absorption of both isomers in MeOH can be attributed to their different HOMO - LUMO gap ( Figure S6a , Supporting Information ) , which critically depends on the proximity between the PtC bond and the non - bonding electron pair on the NMe bridge . [ 22 ] While in aerated methanol ( 50 μm ) , the luminescence of both complexes was weak , as characterized by low quantum yields ( below 0.0015 , Table S6 , Supporting Information ) ; in degassed methanol , their luminescent quantum yield increased ≈2 - 4 times ( still remaining lower than 0.005 ) , which demonstrated the triplet nature of the excited states of these monomers , but also suggested that O 2 is not so good at quenching the monomer emission . This observation was confirmed by the singlet oxygen generation quantum yield , which was moderate in aerated methanol solution ( φΔ = 0.44 for [ 1]OAc , 0.11 for [ 2]OAc ) . The photodynamic properties of both complexes were hence limited as monomers in methanol . In frozen MeOH \/ EtOH mixtures ( 77 K , Figure S8b , Supporting Information ) , the phosphorescence quantum yield was further increased by a factor > 20 for [ 1]OAc and > 100 for [ 2]OAc ( see Table S6 , Supporting Information ) , suggesting possible intermolecular ( triplet - triplet annihilation ) or intramolecular ( vibrational ) quenching routes at room temperature . Limited quenching by O 2 was confirmed by luminescent lifetime measurements ( Table S6 and Figure S8 , Supporting Information ): for both isomers , biexponential decay was observed , but considering the very low phosphorescence intensity , we interpret the short component τ 1 as a consequence of scattered light from the laser pulse ; the longer lifetime τ 2 , which we interpret as that of the Pt complex , increased by a factor of 2 - 4 upon degassing ( e.g. , from 150 to 602 ns for   for [ 2]OAc , see Table S6 , Supporting Information ) . According to TDDFT calculation on the monomeric cations [ 1 ] + and [ 2 ] + and to data above , the weak emission in methanol can be assigned to triplet ligand - to - ligand charge - transfer ( 3 LLCT ) transitions with a small triplet metal - to - ligand charge - transfer ( 3 MLCT ) character .",

As the peaks identified by the three - way overlap of the LMO2 , TAL1 and LDB1 ChIPseq data were the sites with the highest number of reads in each of the independent samples , we conclude that these regulatory elements   Table showing the number of genes associated with LMO2 ChIPseq peaks that have increased or decreased expression ( > 4 - fold ) in WT compared to Lmo2 −\/− cells . ( D ) Heat map of hierarchically clustered genes that associate with common TAL1 , LMO2 and LDB1 ChIPseq peaks . These genes are either the nearest 5 or 3 gene , or contain the peak within the gene body . Scale bar represents colour index for the log 2 FPKM values . Self - organizing tree analysis identified three clusters , which are numbered 1 to 3 . exhibit the highest affinity for this complex . In the absence of LMO2 , binding of TAL1 only remained at the strongest of these binding sites , albeit at a lower level , whereas the majority of TAL1 binding was found at novel binding sites . It has previously been shown that the interaction of LMO2 with TAL1 directly increases the stability of TAL1 \/ E2A heterodimer ( 57 ) . Experiments with TAL1 DNA - binding deficient mutants showed that DNA - binding activity of TAL1 was dispensable for specification of haematopoietic development ( 53 ) , only when the interaction of the TAL1 HLH domain with LMO2 was retained ( 57 ) . In addition , in the presence of LMO2 , TAL1 could associate with chromatin in the absence of its DNA binding domain , albeit with a lower affinity ( 58 ) . Our motif analysis of the threeway overlap of LMO2 , TAL1 and LDB1 ChIP indicated a very strong enrichment of GATA binding motifs ( Figure 5 ) . Taken together , this indicates that the interaction through LMO2 plays an important role in directing TAL1 to the correct binding sites , whereas without LMO2 , TAL1 has lower DNA binding activity and specificity . Comparison of our data to previously published LDB-1 ChIPseq data in Flk-1 + cells ( 28 ) and in Lin − bone marrow ( 59 ) showed that the overlap is particularly enriched for those LDB1 peaks that are part of the three - way overlap ( 83 % and 51 % of LMO2 , TAL1 and LDB1 ChIP peaks respectively ) . In addition , our and previous studies identify the same list of target genes ( e.g. Tal1 , Gata2 , Runx1 , Lmo2 , Runx2t2 and Sox7 ) . Intersecting the lists of differentially expressed genes reported by Mylona et al . indicated that the Ldb1 −\/− was more similar to the Tal1 −\/− , in line with the developmental block occurring earlier than in the Lmo2 −\/− . Meta - analysis of the LMO2 complex binding sites identified an overrepresentation of regulatory elements important for haematopoietic development . These included transcription factor genes known to be important at the HB stage ( e.g. Fli1 ( 52,59 ) , Gata2 ( 32 ) , Erg ( 55 ) ) , genes that are important for the HE and endothelial - haematopoietic transition ( e.g. Gfi1 ( 60 ) ) , those with known haematopoietic stem cell function ( e.g. Lyl1 ( 61 ) , Stat3 ( 62 ) ) , and transcription factors with more lineage restricted functions ( e.g. Ebf1 ( 63 ) , Gata1 ( 64 ) , Nfe2 ( 65 ) ) . Our findings indicate that already at the HB stage , LMO2 primes transcription factor genes which will be upregulated at later stages of haematopoiesis and thus regulates all steps of haematopoietic development .",

The value of the texture correction factor is based on available SLCH data reported in the literature ( Smit et al . , 1998;Poesen et al . , 2001;Ruysschaert et al . , 2006a ) and at field plot scale in Belgium ( Ruysschaert et al . , 2007c ) . The term ha k refers to the area of arable land in the specific region which has a given USDA k - value ( Ballabio et al . , 2016 ) . In a third step ( Fig . 1 ) , we applied the SLCH rates per country using available data from the literature ( Ruysschaert et al . , 2005(Ruysschaert et al . , , 2006a . Based on these data ( Ruysschaert et al . , 2005(Ruysschaert et al . , , 2006a , SLCH for the sugar beet equals 8.7 t ha −1 per harvest in Belgium , 6 t ha −1 per harvest in Germany , 10 t ha −1 per harvest in Denmark , 10 t ha −1 per harvest in France , 7 t ha −1 per harvest in the Netherlands , 5.6 t ha −1 per harvest in Spain and 4.7 t ha −1 per harvest in United Kingdom . In addition , we analysed data from the grey literature and found that SLCH is ca . 5 t ha −1 per harvest in Greece ( Mikoniati , 2016 ) and 2.3 t ha −1 per harvest in Croatia ( Jurišić et al . , 2011 ) . There is a tendency for smaller SLCH rates in Mediterranean countries compared to north European countries because of the dry soil conditions at harvest time which largely controls the magnitude of SLCH .",

Predicted potency - breadth curves have suggested that a triple combination consisting of one CD4bs - targeting bnAb , one V2 glycan - targeting bnAb and one V3 glycan - targeting bnAb would have the best neutralization coverage against a panel of clade C viruses 7 . One such combination , VRC07 - 523LS ( CD4bs ) , PGT121 ( V3 glycan ) and PGDM1400 ( V2 glycan ) , has been predicted to have 99 % neutralization breadth ( IC 80 < 10 μg ml -1 ) and a geometric mean IC 80 of 0.09 μg ml -1 against a diverse panel of viruses , compared with 76 % neutralization breadth and a geometric mean IC 80 of 2.64 μg ml -1 for VRC01 alone 17 . ( LS refers to a Fc - modified version to extend half - life . ) This specific triple - bnAb combination is in development for potential efficacy testing and has been safely administered to adults without HIV in a recent phase 1 study 18 . We therefore decided to apply PT 80 to predict PE of 20 or 40 mg kg -1 each of PGT121.414.LS , PGDM1400LS and VRC07 - 523LS delivered together IV . Using available serum concentration data 18,19 , steady - state serum concentrations of each bnAb over 16 weeks were simulated based on popPK modeling ( Methods ) . Because data from the LS forms of PGT121 and PGDM1400 are not yet available , the predictions considered a possible increase of 2.5 - fold in elimination half - life conferred by the LS mutation , with 2.5 - fold being a conservative assumption based on the previously reported fourfold increase 20 . Our results suggest that PT 80 > 200 of a bnAb regimen to a given exposing virus would provide 90 % or higher efficacy to block HIV-1 acquisition with that virus . We applied this threshold ( PT 80 > 200 ) in our definition of neutralization coverage . Neutralization coverage by at least one bnAb in the regimen , averaged over time for a 16 - weekly regimen , and to the 47 viruses ( all subtype C ) acquired by 29 placebo recipients from 703\/081 was 71 % ; neutralization coverage averaged over time and to the 70 viruses ( 90 % subtype B ) acquired by 35 placebo recipients from 704\/085 was 73 % ( Fig . 6a , b ) . In contrast , neutralization coverage of VRC01 ( at 30 mg kg -1 ) averaged over time and to the 703\/081 or 704\/085 viruses was 8 % .",

    "text": "In the case of the signal process , top quarks are produced more abundantly relative to their antiquark partners due to the charge asymmetry of the W boson radiated from the initial - state quark in pp collisions at the LHC . This leads to a higher relative background contamination in the l − final state arising from top antiquark decay compared to the l + final state from top quark decay , as shown in Fig . 7 . As a result , the measurement in the l − final state is more sensitive to the sources that significantly alter the background contributions along with the signal , compared to the ones that impact the signal contribution only . This is reflected in Table 3 where the uncertainties from the signal modeling are lower for the l − case ; whereas other sources , except for the ones listed under flavor - dependent JES , that alter the background contributions along with the signal have a larger impact on the total uncertainty . In the case of the flavor - dependent Table 3 : Summary of the m t uncertainties in GeV for each final - state lepton charge configuration . The statistical uncertainties are obtained by performing the fits again in each case while fixing the nuisance parameters to their estimated values from data . With the exception of the flavor - dependent JES sources , the total systematic uncertainty is obtained from the quadrature sum of the individual systematic sources . The amount of statistical fluctuations in the systematic shifts are quoted within parentheses whenever alternative simulated samples with systematic variations have been used . These are determined from 1000 pseudo - experiments in each case . Entries with < 0.01 denote that the magnitude of the systematic bias is less than 0.01 .",

Quantification of intracellular lipid and extracellular calcified matrix deposition as proxies for adipogenesis and osteogenesis of MSCs revealed that the stiffness of Dex - TA tethered to cells played an essential role in their lineage commitment . Specifically , single - cellresolution analysis of MSC differentiation revealed that the adipogenic population fraction inversely correlated with microgel stiffness ( Figure 2q ) , while the osteogenic population fraction was characterized by a positive correlation with microgel stiffness ( Figure 2r ) . It is of note , that the single - cell - microgel platform offered unique opportunities toward handling , manipulation , and analysis of cells . For example , single - cellmicrogel analysis revealed the heterogeneity in lineage commitment within a population of differentiating stem cells under controlled chemical and mechanical stimuli . Furthermore , the single - cell microgels were demonstrated to be compatible with label - free analyses , which offered the opportunity of time - lapse monitoring of cell behavior in 3D while minimizing methodology - induced biases by omitting destructive analyses techniques .

    "text": "As PSCs have demonstrated a photoconversion energy as high as other commercial solar devices ( CdTe , CIGS , polycrystalline Si ) , one of the key challenges is achieving their long term stable performance when exposed to outdoor conditions . It can be seen from Table 3 and 5 that PSCs are fabricated with a wide variety of materials and design architectures , many of which are intrinsically unstable . It can also be noted that even the similar PSC architectures fabricated at different laboratories resulted in different stability , which is because the durability of these devices largely depends on the purity of starting materials , fabrication methods and conditions , and also the characteristics of the device interfaces . Unlike silicon and thin film solar cells where decades of research has brought them to deliver a stable performance over 20 years with negligible intrinsic degradation , these materials resembles OPVs where instability mostly arises from the materials components itself such as photo - oxidation , change in morphologies over time , and interfacial degradation . [ 273 ] We therefore believe that stability protocols of PSCs are more likely to follow the consensus being developed for OPVs [ 274 ] and DSCs [ 12,243 ] as the device degradation involves chemical modifications . For a detailed overview of the protocols that may be adopted while reporting stability of PSCs , we refer to the comprehensive reports highlighting various ISOS protocols to be adopted while measuring and reporting operational stability ( indoor and outdoor ) . [ 12,243,274 ] Although so far , not many reports have followed any standard protocol while reporting stability of PSCs , we recommend that the perovskite community should follow few considerations while reporting such data . Most importantly the overestimation in PV performance of PSCs due to anomalous hysteresis and their erroneous efficiency reporting ( missing IV data for reverse and forward scan , stabilized maximum power output and statistical analysis ) must be carefully looked at . [ 275 ] For a reliable device characterization , we suggest a measurement protocol developed by Zimmermann et al . [ 276 ] The protocol is derived from standard J - V measurements , power point tracking and stabilized PV parameters as well as characteristics extracted from time resolved current density - voltage measurements . The PSCs research community needs to report stabilized PV performance for both scan directions and preferably the J - V curves at various scan conditions ( delay time , scan rate etc . ) in order to provide a clearer picture of device performance . We recommend a recently published checklist while reporting the PV performance , [ 275 ] ( ii ) while reporting the stability of PSCs , the protocols such as those for dark or indoor testing ( ISOS - D-1 , shelf - life , ISOS - D-2 , high temperature storage , and ISOS - D-3 , damp heat ) or those for outdoor ( ISOS - O-1 - 3 ) [ 273 ] must be followed so that a consensus on the stability is made and a true picture of device performance is obtained .",

    "text": "In the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic , antibody testing was proposed by several countries as a means of gathering data on the spread of the virus and\/or , to inform strategies to ease restrictive measures , and test and trace programmes ( Baraniuk 2020 ) particularly to identify the source of clusters of infections ( Normile 2020 ) . In the UK , the Prime Minister said antibody testing was a potential ' game - changer ' ( BBC 2020 ) . The presence of antibodies indicates an individual 's immune system has responded to the virus . Antibody tests differ from antigen tests that determine whether someone is currently infected . In the case of this virus , at the time this study was conducted in April \/ May 2020 , scientists and the public had little understanding of the longevity of antibodies , and whether they provided immunity to reinfection or transmission . The current ( January 2021 ) knowledge is that antibodies are maintained for at least eight months ( Dan 2021 ) and for at least three months in those who had mild COVID-19 symptoms ( Rodda 2020 ) . There is evidence that people can be re - infected ( Parry 2020;Hall 2021 ) and work continues to gain a greater understanding of antibodies and immunity . Interim findings from a large cohort study of COVID-19 antibody - positive and antibody - negative UK health workers found antibodies , produced in response to a previous infection , provided 83 % protection against reinfection for five months ( Hall 2021 ) . Although the findings have been welcomed , the sample consists primarily of women under the age of 60 and it is too early to determine immunity against the new variants of the virus ( Ledford 2021 ) . The cohort study will follow participants for 12 months to provide further data on how long immunity lasts and the degree to which someone with immunity can transmit the virus to others ( Hall 2021 ) .",

    "text": "To evaluate the significance of the commonly methylated genes ( n = 1187 ) , categorization was implemented . The commonly affected pathways were prominently plasma membrane - associated receptors and components , cytoskeleton and adhesion \/ junction - related proteins , ion channels \/ transporters and energy homeostasis ( Figure 3H ) . Considering the distinct physicochemical properties between AgNPs and GO , pathway analysis was further performed for the differentially methylated genes ( Figure 3I , J ) . A multitude of genes were found differentially methylated between AgNPs and GO in both A549 and 293 T cells , including genes responsible for gap junction ( e.g. , LPAR1 and GNAI3 ) [ 24 ] upon AgNPs exposure and genes encoding proteins involved in substance metabolism ( e.g. , PDE5A and GFPT1 ) [ 25 ] upon GO exposure . These differences between AgNPs and GO could be attributed to their distinct physicochemical properties and their different mode of interaction with cells including differential subcellular localization . [ 26][27][28][29 ] For example , AgNP dissolves ions , and Ag ions play a major role in AgNP - induced toxic effects ; [ 26 ] GO have different lateral sizes and surface functional groups and have strong association with biomolecules . [ 27 ] Therefore , we looked into the changes of 5 - mC levels responding to Ag ions and GO with different lateral sizes and surface modifications . Previous studies demonstrated that Ag particles and Ag ions simultaneously existed inside the cells with a release rate of Ag ions around 10 % . [ 28,30 ] Thus , Ag ions at 0.4 µg mL −1 were used to treat cells , and different from Ag particles , Ag ions did not induce a significant change in 5 - mC content in A549 , 293 T , and THP-1 cells ( Figure S14 , Supporting Information ) . In order to answer whether length \/ size contributes to the influence on DNA methylation induced by ENMs , we deliberately prepared an array of GO with different lateral size , i.e. , S - GO ( smallest ) , I - GO ( intermediate ) , and L - GO ( largest ) , as described in our recent report . [ 28 ] As shown in Figure S18 ( Supporting Information ) , no significant difference could be found among these sized - GO in increasing 5 - mC levels in A549 and 293 T cells . Furthermore , we scrutinized the effect of surface modification on DNA methy lation changes using GO - NH 2 and GO - PEG ( polyethylene glycol coated GO ) , as described in our recent study . [ 31 ] As shown in Figure S19 ( Supporting Information ) , compared with the parental GO and GO - NH 2 , GO - PEG induced a milder increase of 5 - mC levels in A549 and 293 T cells , in agreement with the greater biocompatibility of GO - PEG . [ 31 ] Taken together , these data revealed new insights into the structure - activity relationship for AgNPs and GO : Ag nanoparticles rather than dissolved Ag ions were responsible for the DNA methylation changes ; the surface activity of GO rather than its size played the major role in GO - induced DNA alternations . However , further studies should be considered to identify the physicochemical determinants and nanobio interactions ( e.g. , distinct subcellular localizations ) in inducing different signatures of DNA methylation for diverse ENMs in the future .",

Viral concentrations in samples collected from the sewer system of the city of Paris are plotted in Fig . 3 . Results showed that the median of data taken from the sewer visually correlated with the city trends , emphasizing the possibility to refine the virus spreading in the area . Monitoring of individual sampling points showed some specific dynamics before the start of the second wave , demonstrating the possibility to detect local cluster using sewer monitoring ( lower panel ) . For example , an important concentration was locally detected during week 22 ( October 14 , 2020 ) , at the beginning of the second wave , probably due to local clusters . Same trend could be easily observed before the second lockdown .",

    "text": "To investigate the influence of ligand clustering on receptor mediated uptake , a series of eight micelle formulations were used : 0%F-100%mix , the untargeted control containing unfunctionalized LDP ( 0%F ) used as 100 % of the micelle and 10%F-100%mix , 20%F-60%mix , 30%F-40%mix , 40%F-30%mix , 60%F-20 % , 70%F-20%mix and 100%F-10%mix are formulations presenting a similar amount of folate in total . UV - Vis data show statistically similar numbers of folate per micelle by one way ANOVA analysis between the different groups at the 95 % confidence interval ( Figure 2c ) . We used FR overexpressing KB cells to evaluate targeting and binding of the micelles to receptors on the cell surface . After a 24 h period of incubation , the highest cell associated fluorescence was observed for cells incubated with the 20%F-60%mix formulation ( Figure 3a ) . The measured EC50 ( concentration producing 50 % binding ) was observed to be the lowest for the 20%F-60%mix micelle . To facilitate discussion , we approximated the apparent dissociation constants of the tested micelles ( K D ) by fitting the experimental data to a 1:1 binding model for site - specific binding . The apparent micelle K D is given in Table 1 . EC50 and K D values are similar , indicating that there is a direct relationship between binding and the measured fluorescence . The measured dissociation rate constant ( k off ) of the different micelles also show that the optimal 20%F-60%mix formulation had the longest dissociation time ( 2×10 −5 s −1 ) ( Figure 2d , Table 1 ) . To examine the apparent rate of association ( K on ) relationship between the micelles , we used the following equation : k on = k off \/K D and found that the calculated values were not significantly different ( less than 1 order of magnitude apart , Table 1 ) . Confocal analysis and competitive binding experiments confirmed that our observations for binding and targeting are FR mediated and that the mechanism for internalization of targeted LDP is dependent on both energy driven endocytosis and the presence of folate receptors ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) .",

This means we can analyze them by counting bounded chambers in RP 2 space when |147| , |257| and |367| vanish . We expect to find 12 bounded chambers , which would correspond to the 12 solutions for each of the 15 existing configurations . The bounded chambers come in the following way . First , we use the same gauge fixing for the first four particles as explained in section 4.1 . This creates 5 repelling lines , one of them crossing the diagonal of the square [ 0 , 1 ] 2 created by particles 1 and 4 . It is precisely on this line where the soft particle 7 must be . We can have solutions where particle 7 is outside the square [ 0 , 1 ] 2 , since particles 5 and 6 can simultaneously create bounded chambers for each other . We represent this situation in figure A.9 . Left : the first four particles are gauge - fixed . This creates 5 repelling lines , drawn in black , and particle 7 must be on the line that passes through 1 and 4 . Center : we now consider the situation in which the soft particle 7 is in the outside - right(left ) of the square [ 0 , 1 ] 2 . Right : particles 5 and 6 must lie on the blue dashed lines created by particles 7 , 2 and 3 . This only happens if both particles bound each other through particle 4(1 ) ( red and orange lines ) . The two grey bounded chambers are those where particles 5 and 6 can be . This configuration gives rise to 2 different solutions , since particles 5 and 6 can bound each other through particles 1 and 4 when particle 7 is outside the square [ 0 , 1 ] 2 .",

    "text": "The pursuit of good quality FIO data does need to be complemented with continued efforts to understand the differential behaviour of FIOs and pathogens , and the associated implications for modelling the efficacy of mitigations designed to reduce microbial watercourse pollution . Thus , while we have focussed our discussion on FIO modelling it is important for resource managers and policy makers to recognise that FIO models do not necessarily inform on specific pathogen behaviour . However , the nexus of FIO modelling and risk assessment is gaining significant momentum and the use of quantitative microbial risk assessment ( QMRA ) offers another modelling framework with which to estimate human infection risk from exposure to pathogen contaminated waters ( Soller et al . , 2015 ) . Benefits of FIO modelling will be further enhanced if the research community promotes a consistent message to model developers calling for any future model performance criteria to include , as a minimum , an uncertainty analysis of modelled predictions . Thus , the pedigree of uncertainty associated with model outputs needs to be transparent and included as standard in the reporting of any FIO modelling . There are mechanisms that can help deliver this drive for greater awareness of model uncertainty . For example , there are more frequent opportunities to promote knowledge exchange ( KE ) across the science - policy interface enabling scientists and policy - makers to debate the role and impact of model uncertainty . Research Councils in the UK , and in other nations too , are increasingly funding policy - placement opportunities whereby scientists are embedded within government departments thus providing an important route for aiding KE . This should be encouraged in the general field of environmental decision - making using models . In addition , those responsible for funding research could improve model transparency by ensuring that projects with a modelling component fulfil basic uncertainty analysis criteria . Indeed , several academic journals , whose remit includes environmental modelling , now stipulate uncertainty analysis of any modelling as a prerequisite for publication . This template should also be adopted at the funding stage for research projects .",

    "text": "By introducing the concept of genetically encoded BRET - activated PDT , we propose a viable solution of the bottleneck problem of limited treatment depth of PDT , while avoiding problems of currently available chemically assembled BRET complexes . For the demonstration of the concept , we designed a genetically encoded NanoLuc - miniSOG platform , which can be delivered by a properly selected carrier to a tumor , and then triggered by the injection of furimazine substrate . To assess the efficiency of this pair , we expressed NanoLuc - miniSOG BRET - pair in breast ductal carcinoma BT-474 cancer cells and then examined its operation in vitro and in vivo . Spectroscopic characterization of BT-474 \/ NanoLuc - miniSOG cell line confirmed that BRET between NanoLuc and miniSOG    c Tumor - growth curves for control group ( mice treated with PBS only ) , as well as for groups carrying NanoLuc or NanoLuc - miniSOG LVs particles and treated with furimazine . Data are presented as the mean ± SD ( n = 6 ) . d In vivo bioimaging of animals bearing HER2 - positive tumors and injected i.t . with LVs - NanoLuc - miniSOG or LVs - NanoLuc . Three mice from each group on the 13th day after LVs injection are presented indeed occurs with the BRET ratio reaching 0.74 ± 0.05 ( Fig . 1d ) . The recorded ratio is in agreement with our previous data 23 , as well as with data for other BRET - based genetically encoded sensor systems 33,34 , confirming a high efficiency of the pair . We demonstrated by MTT assays that NanoLuc - miniSOG efficiently kills the cancer cells in the presence of furimazine ( Fig . 1e ) , while other tests confirmed that the endogenous bioluminescence can serve as a light source to activate the miniSOG for ROS generation ( Fig . 1f ) . Using the model of mice bearing engineered BT-474 cells expressing NanoLuc - miniSOG , we recorded TGI exceeded 72 % after the injection of furimazine without external light irradiation ( Fig . 2 ) . It means that the inhibition of tumor growth occurs due to BRET - induced PDT , although cytotoxicity of oxidized product of furimazine could also partially contribute to the cell death ( Fig . 2b ) . It is also important that bioluminescence imaging can be used in our case to assess BRET efficiency in vivo . The differences of the average luminescence signal with or without Rf in animals evidenced an efficient process of energy transfer from the donor ( oxidized NanoLuc luciferase - substrate ) to the acceptor ( miniSOG ) in the case of tumor Rf saturation ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Finally , genetic nature of proposed NanoLuc - miniSOG BRET - pair allowed us to use targeted viral system for gene delivery precisely into tumor ( Fig . 4 ) . Using HER2 - specific LVs carrying NanoLuc - miniSOG gene we achieved significant regression ( TGI 67 % ) of HER2 - positive xerograph tumor in the animal model , confirming a high efficiency of the proposed concept . We foresee several major advantages of the proposed concept of genetically encoded BRET - activated PDT over currently present chemically assembled BRET - based systems for PDT . First , the genetic nature of functional PDT elements provides an ideal spatial architecture of the BRET construct , conditioning optimal distance between the internal triggering source and the PS , which is obviously very difficult or impossible in the case of chemical assembling . Second , the proposed approach does not require any sophisticated and costly chemical conjugation protocols to generate functional BRET pair for PDT . Third , as showed in our studies , despite certain local toxic effects in organs due to furimazine injection , genetic encoding nature of synthesized protein complexes makes them safe and easily excretable from the organism , which is not the case for many chemically assembled structures . Finally , as probably the main advantage , the used principle of genetic encoding opens up novel appealing prospective for future improvements of PDT systems profiting from on genetic engineering approaches . In particular , the expression of used NanoLuc - miniSOG pair can be controlled on the genetic level by properly designed promoters ( e.g. , telomerase promoters ) , which are specific to some tumors . In addition , by fusing with a well - known protein localization motif ( nuclear , membrane , mitochondrial ) or a whole protein , the genetically encoded pair can be easily directed to any cell compartment ( or even sub - compartment ) . Furthermore , the use of different targeting molecules in the composition of lentiviruses or other carriers renders possible an easy re - direction of a genetically encoded BRET - activated system on any tumor type , while the therapeutic action will address not only the primary tumor , but also its metastasis distributed in the organism . Thus , the employment of genetically encoded constructs provides novel opportunities to direct BRETinduced generation of active forms of oxygen to different cellular compartments or particular cell lines , which is hardly possible with chemically assembled BRET systems .",

    "text": "We arrive at novel and valuable insights into the relation between identification processes and ethical decision - making in family firms . In terms of the generalizability of our research - it was our primary focus to obtain an insightful and rich understanding of ethical behavior in family firms . Therefore , we started with a well - selected data set , which is in line with current standards ( e.g. , Salvato and Corbetta 2013 ) . However , we acknowledge the interviews conducted with a sample of 19 family firm employees allow only limited interpretations of the connection between identity and ethical behavior . Given that our study is limited to German family firms , our findings could be subject to bias due to the single - nation focus . Each nationality and culture has different values , and individuals ' ethical awareness could be influenced by their cultural background . To gain a more detailed understanding , we suggest taking our research as a basis to explore further the family firm 's unique characteristics and ethical behavior against other cultural settings . For instance ,   has recently revealed contradictions between family and external expectations of Corporate Social Responsibility reporting measures in Latin American family businesses . From an ethics perspective , we did not assess examples of ( un)ethical behavior . An ( objective ) assessment and evaluation of actual ( un)ethical behavior is an important next step to interpret whether or not the approach to an ethical situation is congruent with the underlying value system . We also call for future research to examine the temporal dimension of identification , an important facet which is rarely studied . As our results show , identification is not static but dynamic in nature . Identification processes involve many aspects , both on the individual and organizational level . Identifying with an organization and its values is an ongoing journey for employees . Some parts of an individual 's identity even evolve along with the sense of belonging to an organization , which needs further investigation ( Knapp et al . 2013;Kreiner et al . 2006 ) .",

    "text": "This study is not without limitations . First of all , data collection started about a month before any COVID-19 vaccine was officially approved , that is , in a period in which accurate information was not available on the characteristics of the candidate vaccines , in particular about their efficacy , safety , and the possible side effects . With the start of the vaccination campaign , the intention to get vaccinated may likely have changed in light of the clearer information about the vaccines , the experiences of people who have already received them , and , not less importantly , government decisions and the daily news broadcast by the media . As specified above , the data on the time course of the vaccination campaign in Italy are in line with those of the neighbouring countries of the EU ( around 60 % of fully vaccinated people ) . However , the percentage of people still hesitant about the vaccine should not be underestimated , particularly in the older age groups ( e.g. , over 60s and 70s ) , where there is currently the lowest adhesion to vaccines ( Italian Ministry of Health , 2021b ) . For this reason , further studies are needed to verify whether the type of persuasive message that we have identified as the most effective in promoting intention to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine also works in increasing intention to get the currently approved vaccines and the consequent behaviour and its impact on different socio - demographic groups . Secondly , since we used a convenience sample recruited by advertising the study through various online channels ( e.g. , Facebook groups ) , we can not conclude that our results are generalisable to the general population and , above all , that participants did not already have high levels of vaccination intention . However , the heterogeneity of participants in terms of socio - demographic characteristics may have partially reduced this bias . Thirdly , although in the literature there is no convincing evidence that affective attitudeunlike anticipated affective reactionscan predict vaccination intention , future studies with larger samples could simultaneously manipulate both components of the attitude ( cognitive vs affective ) plus anticipated affective reactions to clarify better if and how these processes are mutually exclusive in the context of the decision - making process related to COVID-19 vaccination . In addition , it should be noted that we have not focused on all the variables of the TPB model but only on attitude and intention . Future studies should also consider , for example , the possible effect of subjective norms on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID , since the literature shows that subjective norms , after attitude , are the strongest predictors of vaccination intentions ( e.g. , Askelson et al . , 2010 ) . Injunctive norms , i.e. what significant others ( family , friends ) think the person should do ( to get vaccinated or not ) , and descriptive norms , i.e. what they do themselves ( they intend to get vaccinated or not ) , are both aspects that could have a substantial impact on the decision to get vaccinated , especially in consideration of the context of uncertainty ( e.g. , doubts about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines ) in which this decision is taken . Furthermore , considering that many countries are starting to vaccinate or consider vaccinating children and young people , studying the impact of social influences is even more relevant . Indeed , younger people 's attitudes toward vaccines appear to be heavily influenced by social norms ( Rambout et al . , 2014 ) ; in this perspective , learning that most people significant to them ( e.g. , parents or friends ) get vaccinated can represent , for the youngest , an important motivational factor .",

First , we conducted the study in the unique setting of Matlab , Bangladesh , so findings may not be more widely generalizable . Still , unlike many non - population - based randomized controlled trials , our probability - based sample allowed for inferences to a defined population . Second , the analysis was based on cross - sectional , observational data , which limited our ability to make causal inferences . To improve our ability to make causal inferences , we established a clearer temporal ordering between treatment and outcomes by including a lifetime measure of microfinance participation and outcomes measured at interview , in the prior week , or in the prior year . We also leveraged pre - program and exogenous characteristics to model the propensity for participation in microfinance . These characteristics included circumstances in childhood ( religious affiliation , maternal schooling , economic standing , natal - home location ) , at marriage ( age in years , own schooling , partner 's schooling ) , and exogenous location of residence ( inside \/ outside embankment ; fixed neighborhood cluster ) . Empirically , we achieved balance in observed pre - program characteristics across groups and found no evidence of bias due to unobserved endogeneity .",

    "text": "In this study , we utilized an alternative design principle and revealed that the metagratings based on extraordinary optical diffraction ( EOD ) can achieve arbitrary wavefront shaping with extreme angle tolerance in a broadband spectral range . The meta - atoms in the EOD metagratings were formed by uniformly sized plasmonic nanorods , and the local periodicity between the meta - atoms determines a discrete set of diffraction channels . Based on EOD 17,19,47 , an architecture , in which plasmonic nanorods were placed on top of a dielectric spacer with a metallic background , was employed to funnel the impinging light into the desired diffraction channel with near - unity efficiency . By further continuously displacing the nanorod within each unit cell according to the strategy of a detour phase 48 , customized phase profiles for molding arbitrary wavefronts of light can be generated . Because the phase modulation rule for a EOD metagrating is intrinsically independent of the incident angles and wavelengths , the wavefront shaping capabilities are robust for a broad bandwidth and for an extremely large range of incident angles ( close to the grazing incidence ) . Our proposed EOD metagrating does not rely on complicated and asymmetric meta - atom inclusions [ 49][50][51][52][53][54 ] and thus significantly simplifies the metasurface design procedures and lowers the fabrication demand , which is highly desirable for various holographic applications , including high - fidelity three - dimensional displays , data encryption , and anti - counterfeiting . Figure 1a shows an illustration of the proposed EOD metagrating composed of periodic arrays of identical plasmonic nanorods with width w and length L , which are placed above a dielectric spacer of thickness h and a metallic background . The facile binary EOD metagrating achieves near - unity efficiency light steering without the necessity of spatially varying meta - atoms to mimic a blazed grating ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . The EOD metagrating works in specific diffractive regimes , where only zeroth and −first ( or first ) diffraction orders are allowed to propagate in free space . Those EOD regimes can be determined by the following conditions , 2π",

The loops of these four regions contain the most highly reactive , exposed nucleotides . The remainder of the most highly reactive nucleotides are situated in bulges , internal loops , single - stranded regions linking SLs and the closing pairs of helices , with the exception of G 90 , U101 and A320 . The tip of SL5 contains mainly unreactive nucleotides , possibly indicating kissing - loop interactions involved in dimer initiation . Nucleotides that were predicted to be base - paired in SL1 were unreactive to 1M7 , with the exception of A131 . As the A residue 3 0 of this was predicted to be bulged , and is unreactive , it is likely that the bulge forms consistently at A131 and not at A132 ( shown in Figure 2 ) . Predicted base - paired nucleotides in SL2 are relatively unreactive , except for closing pairs and G - U pairs . The exceptions are nucleotides U244 - G246 , which are highly reactive ; this may indicate that the internal loop 3 0 of this is larger and includes these nucleotides . Structural predictions using the RNA structure programme ( 44 ) and 1M7 reactivities as pseudo free - energy constraints suggest that this is the case in the alternative structure ( shown in Figure 2 ) . Minimal free energy predictions suggested that the SL2 structure is maintained independently of adjacent sequences . To validate this hypothesis and search for LRIs that the single - stranded regions of SL2 may form with other areas of the packaging signal , we transcribed SL2 RNA independently , examined its 1M7 reactivity , and compared the data with SL2 in the context of the 511 - nt RNA ( Figure 1B ) . Nucleotide reactivities are broadly similar across SL2 , whether analysed alone or in the context of the extended 5 0 and 3 0 structure , suggesting that SL2 forms independently of 5 0 and 3 0 sub - domains , i.e. independent of LRIs . Subtle differences in nucleotide reactivity were noted between the structures shown in Figure 1A and B , which may reflect minor experimental variation .",

    "text": "where θ 0 is the initial angle of the platelet ( Figure S6 , Supporting Information ) . By comparing the predictions of this geometrical model with the experimental data , we find that the theoretical analysis slightly overestimates the absolute θ values but captures   reasonably well the dependence of the platelet angle on the applied global strain . A more detailed analysis of the platelet angle as a function of the imposed strain can be obtained by performing finite element simulations of the platelet - laden composite ( Figure 3B and Movie S4 , Supporting Information ) . To enable a direct comparison with the experimental observations , a composite containing platelets aligned out - of - plane was first strained along the direction that was mechanically loaded in the experiment ( x axis ) . Top and side views of the platelets at an applied strain of 100 % show a good qualitative agreement between the simulations and the experimental microscopy images ( Figure 3A , B ) . With the help of these simulations , we also studied the response of the platelets when the global strain is applied parallel to the alignment plane ( y axis ) . Our simulations indicate that this loading configuration does not lead to any significant rotation of the platelets , which explains the anisotropic nature of the strain - induced color change ( Figures 2E and 4A ) . A quantitative comparison between simulations and experiments for composites loaded along the color - changing direction reveals that the finite element analysis correctly captures the experimentally observed trend between the platelet angle and the applied strains .",

    "text": "A weakness of this study is the retrospective data collection of residential address history , which can be prone to recall bias . We were also limited by the numbers available for the analysis sample due to the criteria for eligibility being based on continued lifetime residence in a small geographic area . It was necessary to dichotomise OSC as to provide greater statistical power for stratified models ( i.e. to keep cell sizes to an appropriate size ) . This dichotomisation was also appropriate when this variable was used as a covariate , as previous research found that significant differences in health outcomes were only found between \" professional or managerial occupations \" compared to the rest ( Gale et al . , 2016 ) . We dichotomised other covariates ( e.g. smoking status ) as they were not recorded in the same way for childhood and adulthood and therefore dichotomisation was used to aid interpretation of change over time . The analysis sample was broadly similar in terms of selected characteristics compared with the full cohort at age 70 , but selection bias may have caused a higher number of participants from lower socioeconomic groups being included . The issue of selection bias was partly addressed by running the sensitivity analysis using a sample with different assumptions . For addresses within the Edinburgh area , the precision of the addresses supplied varied and therefore , for a small number of addresses that did not have a house number , the error between actual participant residence and geocoded address was larger as we took the centre of their street . In addition , by geocoding using contemporary sources , we have assumed that the street layout was the same as it is today for the majority of the addresses , with only minor changes to the street content . However we acknowledge that these small changes could have affected the precision of the park exposure estimate for the earlier time periods . Given that we were geocoding a relatively small number of addresses , we were able to employ a system to detect information lost compared with what was supplied , so that if the results were unsatisfactory they would be geocoded manually . This ensured that addresses that had changed significantly ( e.g. demolished ) would be geocoded to the same accuracy as those that were able to be geocoded with contemporary sources ( < 3 m ) . Given the complexity of the existing analysis , with multiple exposures from different time points , we were unable to include the examination of non - linearity . However , we would encourage this in future analyses , especially using the forthcoming cognitive data waves in the LBC1936 .",

Together with the sharpness of the peak , the steep decline indicates that the jet is extremely narrow and that most of the outflow energy of GW170817 resides in the jet . Through simple analytical arguments we are able to place a constraint on the geometry , θ v 8θ j ( θ v 6θ j with semi - analytical modeling ; θ v is the viewing angle and θ j is the jet half - opening angle ) , and implies θ j 5 o if we further use the viewing angle constraint provided by the LIGO - Virgo Collaboration .

Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine independent risk factors for pre - eclampsia in both datasets . The order of variable selection was determined by the χ 2 statistic for each potential variable and the forward selection step could be followed by removal of variables in one or more backward elimination steps . We calculated receiver operating characteristics curves and determined screening test characteristics at a 25 % , 10 % , and 5 % false positive rate . For internal validation we evaluated the calibration and discrimination ( 10 - fold cross validation ) of the model using methods described by Altman et al . 30 Calibration was assessed by plotting the observed proportion of events against the predicted probabilities . For the cross validation , participants were stratified by region ( New Zealand , Australia , Ireland , and UK ) , pre - eclampsia status ( positive or negative ) , and gestation ( < 260 days or ≥260 days ) and randomly allocated to one of 10 groups . Tenfold cross validation was then performed , with 90 % of the data used to generate a model , and estimation of disease risk was performed in the 10 % remaining .

    "text": "An alternative strategy is to use an unsupervised approach , which defines relevant regions across the genome first , independently of any phenotype information , and then tests methylation levels in these predefined regions against a phenotype ( 19,20,26 ) . In this study , we propose a new unsupervised approach for testing differential methylation in regions against continuous phenotype such as age , tumor size or marker protein concentrations . Note that in the proposed mixed effects model ( Supplementary Text , Section 1 ) , the phenotype variable is included as an independent variable and the methylation values as the outcome variable . Therefore , no distributional assumptions ( e.g. normal distribution ) are made for the continuous phenotypes . Table 1 lists several previously proposed unsupervised methods . A challenge with unsupervised approaches is their lack of specificity . Unlike gene expression data , the regional boundary of DNA methylation is often not well defined . Therefore , currently available approaches that summarize methylation levels in a region using mean or median methylation levels of the CpGs within the region may have results that vary depending on the boundaries of the region . In addition , when testing associations between phenotype and the summarized methylation levels in a genomic region , the spatial correlations between CpG sites within the region is ignored .",

The lack of discovery of a Higgs boson below 114 GeV or of any new states has forced supersymmetry into fine - tuning territory , partially undermining its original motivation . Moreover , new theoretical developments , mostly influenced by extra dimensions and by the connection between strongly - interacting gauge theories and gravity on warped geometries , have led the way to the construction of new models of electroweak symmetry breaking [ 1][2][3][4][5][6 ] . Still , the complete replacement of the Higgs sector with strongly - interacting dynamics seemed hard to implement , mostly because of constraints from electroweak data . A more promising approach is to keep the Higgs boson as an effective field arising from new dynamics [ 7,8 ] which becomes strong at a scale not much larger than the Fermi scale . There has been various attempts to realize such scenario , including the Little Higgs [ 2 ] , Holographic Higgs as Goldstone bosons [ 5,6 ] or not [ 9 ] , and other variations .",

    "text": "Probably the environment is the only sector that got an immensely positive impact form this COVID-19 scenario . International energy agency reported that global coal use was 8 % lower in the first quarter in 2020 . Due to the Locked down , transport , industry , and all non - essential sectors were closed , which reduced emission significantly . NASA ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) and ESA ( European Space Agency ) published recent data ( Fig . 9 ) declaring that compared to last year , NO 2 emission reduced by 30 % ( Dutheil et al . , 2020 ) . The decline in PM2.5 was significant in the US , UAE , Italy , and Spain , in the month of March , due to cumulative lockdown ( Chauhan and Singh , 2020 ) . Noticeably , in China , the overall air quality improved as NO 2 reduced by 22.8 μg \/ m 3 , PM 2.5 decreased by 1.4 μg \/ m 3 particularly in Wuhan ( Zambrano - Monserrate et al . , 2020 ) and by 18.9 μg \/ m 3 in 367 other cities ( Lal et al . , 2020 ) . However , some cities also witnessed the air quality index over 100 . These reductions accounted for lowering the particle loadings ( Wang et al . , 2020f ) . Air quality showed improvement near the Yangtze River Delta ( YRD ) region , which is one of the economic city - clusters in Eastern China . However , the percentage of PM 2.5 attributed to residences and long - range transport . Additionally , 44 cities of northern China marked 69.5 % reduction in human mobility improving the air quality as SO 2 , PM2.5 , PM10 , NO 2 , and CO decreased by 6.76 % , 5.93 % , 13.66 % , 24.67 % , and 4.58 % , respectively ( Bao and Zhang , 2020 ) . In 2017 , the energy sector in Italy ( industry and transport ) contributed 80 % of the total country GHG emissions . COVID-19 related lockdown caused an overall 20 % reduction of GHG emission , lower than emissions of March and April in 2015 - 2019 ( Rugani and Caro , 2020 ) . In Milan , Italy , partial lockdown restricted the people movement , and total lockdown terminated industry and transport activities . Reduction of PM10 , PM2.5 , BC , benzene , CO , and NOx level was observed because of a decrease in road transport ( Collivignarelli et al . , 2020 ) . In Barcelona , PM10 reduced by 31 %   and NO 2 by 50 % ( Baldasano , 2020 ) . Initially , Madrid and Barcelona contributed 55 % and 56 % of NO 2 emission from traffic . However , due to the COVID-19 scenario - based lockdown , since March , Barcelona and Madrid ( Spain ) , emitted 50 % and 62 % less NO 2 respectively ( Baldasano , 2020 ) . In the continental USA , PM2.5 reduced during the lockdown , especially in urban counties and wherever non - essential businesses were closed ( Berman and Ebisu , 2020 ) . During the lockdown period ( March 19th to April 14th , 2020 ) , reduction in PM2.5 , NO 2 , and CO concentration by 21 % , by 35 % , CO by 49 % , was noticed in Almaty , Kazakhstan ( Kerimray et al . , 2020 ) . Sao Paolo Brazil also encountered a reduction in CO and NO 2 emission by 64.8 % , and 77.3 % ( Nakada and Urban , 2020 ) . Further , PM10 , NO 2 , and SO 2 emissions decreased by more than half during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Salé City , Morocco ( Otmani et al . , 2020 ) . India , every year battles more than 350,000 new cases of childhood asthma and 16000 premature death attributed to air pollution , mostly NO 2 and PM ( 2.5 - 10 μm ) generated from fossil fuels and transportation sector ( CREA , 2020 ) .",

The pursuit of this objective has a public service motivation . At this regard , it is important to note that this research , in the framework of the COVIDBENS project , had high social impact and it was one of the precursors of this type of monitoring in Spain , for the surveillance of SARSCoV-2 in wastewater .

However , clinical genomic surveillance is expensive , inefficient , lacks community representation and has sampling bias due to testing of only symptomatic individuals and to systemic healthcare disparities , particularly in poor and underserved communities ( Kaplan et al . , 2021;Karthikeyan et al . , 2021;Peccia et al . , 2020;Smith et al . , 2021;Wolfe et al . , 2022 ) . Variants of SARS - CoV-2 can also be tracked in community wastewater ( wastewater genomic surveillance ) which offers cost - effective , unbiased and real - time capture of virus spread and dynamic ( Ahmed et al . , 2022a;Karthikeyan et al . , 2021;Michael - Kordatou et al . , 2020;Smith et al . , 2021 ) . In addition , wastewater genomic surveillance tracks existing and new emerging variants , for which targeted assays do not exist as yet . These data are valuable for transmission network analysis and interpretation , as well as an emerging technology for tracing viral evolution ( Karthikeyan et al . , 2021;Vo et al . , 2022 ) . However , wastewater genomic surveillance remains a challenge , since low viral loads , matrix effect , heavily fragmented RNA , poor enrichment or amplification of SARS - CoV-2 genome and PCR inhibitors could lead to poor sequencing quality ( Karthikeyan et al . , 2021;Wolfe et al . , 2022 ( Heijnen et al . , 2021 ) while Lee et al . applied RT - qPCR assays that detect mutations present in Alpha to wastewater samples ( Lee et al . , 2021 ) . Jahn et al . used wastewater genome sequencing to detect Alpha , Beta and Gamma variants ( Jahn et al . , 2021 ) . Yaniv et al . developed RT - qPCR assays for Alpha , Beta , Gamma and Delta ( Yaniv et al . , 2021a(Yaniv et al . , , 2021b . In addition , in our previous studies ( Avgeris et al . , 2021;Galani et al . , 2022 ) , we showed that wastewaterbased epidemiology ( WBE ) can predict hospitalizations and ICP admissions , whereas using our novel Nested - Seq assay for SARS - CoV-2 mutation \/ variant analysis we provided real - time monitoring of SARS - CoV-2 variants and identified those strains with selective advantage to become dominant in community \/ population level .",

It is becoming increasingly evident that immune checkpoint blockade and genomics are not separate silos , but rather linked to each other . This is because abnormalities in DNA damage repair and DNA replication can result in increased rates of somatic mutations in tumors . In turn , the presentation of neo - antigens generated by the mutanome in combination with immune system activation by checkpoint blockade can distinguish normal from tumor tissue . Based on studies demonstrating a relationship between TMB and immunotherapy response ( i.e. , the higher the TMB , the greater the response rate ) and between other gene alterations , such as PDL1 amplification and response , genomics is directly relevant to selecting patients for immune checkpoint blockade . 17,43 Furthermore , the FDA has approved the immune checkpoint inhibitor , pembrolizumab , for any solid tumor with alterations in DNA mismatch repair pathway genes ( e.g. ,MSH2 , MSH6 , MLH1 , PMS2 ) due to associated large increases in TMB . 35 Moreover , TMB increases correlate with a higher neoantigen load based upon somatic mutation data from the TCGA . 44 In turn , these would be expected to be more immunogenic and therefore responsive to immunotherapy . 17 In a retrospective fashion that was unblinded to outcomes , we developed an alternative approach for scoring immune checkpoint blockade matches . In a histology agnostic fashion , we previously reported objective response rates ( ORR , % ) for patients receiving immunotherapy in the setting of low , intermediate , and high TMB . 17 Therefore , we adopted these ORRs as the matching scores for intermediate TMB ( given under the I - PREDICT protocol ( PFS2 ) ; ( iii ) PFS2 versus PFS1 ( immediate prior line of therapy using patients as their own control ) , 7,46 ; ( iv ) percent of patients with a PFS2 \/ PFS1 ratio ≥1.3 ; 7 and ( v ) overall survival ( OS ) . SD , PR , or CR was initially determined per the assessment of the treating physician . Patients with ongoing SD for less than six months at the date of data cut off were considered inevaluable for the DCR . However , they were evaluable for PFS and OS . PFS was defined as the time from the beginning of therapy to disease progression , or the time to last follow up for patients that were progression - free ( patients that were progression - free on the date of last follow up were censored on that date ) . OS was defined as the time from the beginning of therapy to death , or last follow - up date for patients who were alive ( the latter were censored on that date ) . The cut - off date of the analysis was August 15 , 2017 and cut - off date for patients included was consent by end of June 2017 .",

The 5 0 -end of the NTS contained either a hydroxyl or a phosphate as indicated . The reactions were performed in the presence of Mg 2 + and were terminated at the indicated times . Strand transfer products were visualized through agarose gel electrophoresis . Two types of products are observed in this reaction : single end strand transfer events , in which one labeled 40 - mer DNA is covalently linked to the one strand of pUC19 DNA ( migrating as a relaxed circle ) , and double end strand transfer events in which a linear form of the target is generated ( Figure 2 ) . In our experiments the double end strand transfer products formed in the strand transfer assays with the 5 0 phosphate substrate are detected 5 min after the target DNA and Mg 2 + have been added . In contrast , double end strand transfer products formed with the 5 0 -hydroxyl substrate were evident no earlier than after 1 h incubation . The results of these assays demonstrated that , in the presence of the phosphate group on the NTS 5 0 -end , the completion of the transposition process ( characterized by the double end strand transfer band ) occurs $ 30 times faster compared to the data for 5 0 hydroxyl DNA ( Figure 2B ) . Qualitatively similar results are obtained by summing the single end transfer and double end transfer products . This finding clearly indicates that the 5 0 phosphate on the NTS plays an important role in the target capture and\/or the DNA strand transfer reaction ( because we measure these two events through a strand transfer assay , we will use ' strand transfer ' to refer to the combination of both events ) .",

This shows that the possible sterile neutrino flux is hardly sensitive to the presence of antineutrinos , a fact whose origin becomes clear on examination of the denominator in eq.(2.13 ): the multiplier of sin 2 α is very close to unity for any value of ψ owing to the fact thatr d ≃ 1 .

    "text": "We thoroughly evaluate DCA - GMM on synthetic data generated with different variance level and noise level . The higher of these two levels , the harder the clustering task is . The results are reported in Figure 3 , the detailed procedure generating data and evaluation metrics are given in the caption . On all metrics , DCA - GMM shows a phase transition property , i.e. , the algorithm will overwhelmingly success below a curve of noise and variance level . This property verifies the robustness of DCA - GMM to data noise and variance within a cluster . In addition , when increasing the number of sub - problems ( layers from bottom to top ) , the accuracy of DCA - GMM soon saturates on a value close to 1 , this indicates that a small number of sub - problems in DCA - GMM is sufficient to produce a promising clustering result , which is highly preferred in practice . Moreover , the time cost of DCA - GMM is significantly small and thus exhibits its competitive efficiency . Furthermore , error is more robust to data noise than accuracy , because most false anchors detected in the noise case are close to the true ones , which leads to small error .   Figure 3 : DCA - GMM on synthetic data . On a 30 × 30 grid of different noise level and variance level , for each noise and variance pair , we randomly generate data of k = 5 clusters with 300 , 500 , 400 , 300 , 500 samples respectively , and 3 - view features of 200 , 120 , 160 dimensions respectively . Mean vector of each cluster is added into the data as \" anchor \" we expect DCA to find out . In particular , each view of points in each cluster are drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with the variance level , and then Gaussian noises of magnitude equal to the noise level are added to the points . We run DCA - GMM using different number of sub - problems , and report their performance by anchor accuracy , clustering accuracy , anchor error ( 2 relative recovery error ) , mutual information and rand index . The CPU seconds are reported too . Each point on each 3D plot is a result of averaging 10 random trials in the same setting , and its height is the value of metric . Each 3D plot includes layers of surfaces associated with different number of sub - problems , we also report the top layer as a 2D plot below each 3D plot .

    "text": "Our findings highlight a variety of implications for pandemicinformed housing , social and urban policy and research . First , the research revealed high levels of turbulence among share households , with 39 % reporting that either they or another member of their household had moved homes between April and June 2020 . That figure is in comparison to the 14 % of Australians and 35 % of Australian renters that move each year on average ( Australian Bureau of Statistics , 2016 ) . Our data point to a broad range of reasons for these movements , including caring responsibilities ; work opportunities ; returning to family homes ; moving to reduce housing costs when housemates moved out ; leaving to avoid mounting tensions and conflict between housemates ; and returning to countries or states of origin before borders closed . These movements , mostly instigated by the pandemic , represent a dramatic pattern of migration among this cohort and additional research is needed to track the short and long - term impacts of these movements . The geographic clustering of share houses , and low - income rental households more generally , is likely to cause clusters of vacant homes and\/or clusters of households in high housing stress in the short to medium term . Similarly , given that 16 % of respondents were living in overcrowded households and 24 % reported feeling stressed by their lack of control over their domestic space , there are clear implications for greater risk of virus transmission in crowded spaces and mental health outcomes for households coping with spatial and interpersonal conflicts . Such challenges are likely to be common to share households internationally .",

    "text": "In summary , we have developed DiLFM , an algorithmenhanced LFM technique that can substantially reduce reconstruction artifacts and maintain high contrast without any hardware modification even in extremely noisy conditions . To optimize the performance of the proposed DiLFM , we thoroughly discuss the appearance and mechanism of three different kinds of LFM reconstruction artifacts and intake them all into a dictionary patching model to correct them . Furthermore , the proposed dictionary patching increases the reconstruction resolution and contrast by supplying high - resolution and high - contrast information from the training stage . We validate our DiLFM through In the functional imaging experiment , we show DiLFM can discover two times more neurons with improved ΔF \/ F and reduced artifacts disturbance with low light dosage . We hope the scheme can help LFM become a promising and reliable tool for high - speed imaging biological tissues in 3D. The proposed DiLFM achieves superior performance compared to traditional LFM but with full advantages of LFM in other aspects . For example , the volume acquisition rate of DiLFM is independent of the size of the sample and only limited by camera frame rate , compared to other 3D imaging technology . Introducing the dictionary only affects the downstream data processing speed without any sacrifice of capturing rate . It is straightforward to extend DiLFM to a larger FOV or a compact head - mounted LFM 27 . Furthermore , by introducing photon - scattering models into dictionary priors 34 , it is possible to exceed the depthpenetration limitation of DiLFM in in vivo mouse - brain imaging 23 . Borrowing the thoughts from DiLFM of using the versatile dictionary to adopt different imaging environments , other deconvolution energized volumetric imaging methods 22,35 can also use such a prior for better performance in various applications .",

Secondly , for the values of w considered , for small u , v the remainder function takes a large negative value for w large , and increases as w decreases . The order of these hyper - surfaces reverses as u or v increase , and for large values of these variables , the remainder function becomes increasingly negative ( as of course required by the symmetry property and the behaviour at large u ) . For all three variables large , the remainder function approaches a constant which is equal to the asymptotic value of F 6 ( u ) ( about −0.67 ) . In general , it is apparent from Figures 8 - 10 that the remainder function is rather smooth for all values of the cross - ratios .",

Thus , the primary goal of its transformations in the pandemic period is to ensure operations continue through remote solutions . First , it has implemented AR to safeguard the virtual presence of safety engineers at its maintenance sites all over the globe . The concept of AR was not new to the company before the pandemic , but the company only had limited experience . Since the start of the pandemic , the company has prioritized the roll - out of this technology and scaled up the adoption throughout the company . Second , WFH has been adopted , however , at the cost of efficiency , as IT equipment in manufacturing industry requires specific adjustments to allow remote access and such adjustments are usually not optimal . For example , before the pandemic , most software in company M would only be used on local networks for security reasons and employees manually connect local databases to enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) systems . In the pandemic period , such a manual connection was impossible as engineers could not go to sites to get the offline data . Thus , the company has developed an interface which connects ERP to a part of its offline databases . Due to partial database availability , several standard business procedures of the company have been delayed . Third , the company has adopted IoT at its production sites , that is to collect critical production data and use cloud analytics to turn this data into valuable insights about the efficiency of the operations . It is worth mentioning that the adoption of IoT has already been underway for 2 years in the company , and the pandemic has just accelerated the roll - out of this technology . Fourth , using data on the state of its equipment , the company has adopted ML to find patterns that help predict and ultimately prevent equipment failures .",

The incessant and elevated presence in proinflammatory cytokines CINC-1 , CINC-2 , CINC-3 , LIX , and IL-6 , being crucial neutrophil traffickers , cause exacerbated levels of neutrophil incidence , resulting in further tissue damage [ 27,[41][42][43 ] . Unlike FPF - treated wounds , control animals exhibited a significant increase in neutrophil chemoattractants that correlated with the upsurge in neutrophils to the wound bed ( Figure 6B ) . Downregulation of genes , including Ccl12 , Cxcl1 , Cxcl3 , IL-1β , IL-6 , Ptgs2 , and TNF , that contribute to inflammatory responses were observed in FPF - treated animals [ 44][45][46][47 ] . Furthermore , adhesion molecules L - selectin and JAM - A that are critical in neutrophil migration and activation were reduced upon FPF treatment . Both L - selectin and JAM - A heavily influence neutrophil extravasation and infiltration into the ischemic tissue environment [ 48][49][50 ] . Levels of eotaxin , which induces recruitment of not only eosinophils , but also basophils , neutrophils , and macrophages , were significantly reduced in FPF - treated animals [ 51 ] . We also saw significantly lower levels of MIP-1α , RANTES , TREM-1 , and activin A , which are critical macrophage chemoattractants in wound repair [ 52][53][54][55 ] . TWEAK signaling further modulates inflammatory responses and enhances the production of proinflammatory cytokines , including RANTES [ 56 ] . While the expression of RANTES and its functional response to MIP-1α are enhanced during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages , activin A alters macrophage polarization by promoting a proinflammatory M1 phenotype and inhibiting the acquisition of anti - inflammatory M2 macrophage markers [ 55,57 ] . Although we did not find significant differences in the total number of macrophages , we detected a substantially higher number of M2 macrophages in FPF - treated animals ( Figure 6C ) . Concurrently , we also found that FPF treatment led to an increase in fractalkine \/ CX3CL1 , which induces VEGF - mediated angiogenesis potential in CX3CR1 - expressing M2 macrophages [ 58 ] .",

Covariates were selected a priori based on previous literature ( Deary et al . , 2009 ) , including sex , Occupational Social Class ( OSC ) ( Office of Population Censuses and Surveys , 1980 ) of participant 's father , people per room in childhood household , childhood smoking status , OSC of participant , smoking status and alcohol consumption . OSC of the participant 's father was used as a measure of socioeconomic status from childhood and dichotomised into Professional - managerial ( I and II ) and Skilled , partly skilled , unskilled ( III , IV and V ) . Additionally , we used childhood overcrowding as a secondary measure of socioeconomic status , defined as the number of people per household room . Participants were asked at what age they started smoking and were categorised as a childhood smoker if they responded that they had started before age 16 , as per convention ( Hopkinson et al . , 2014 ) . Smoking status at age 70 was dichotomised as smoker or non - smoker . Similarly , alcohol consumption was dichotomised as drinks alcohol or does n't drink alcohol . BMI at age 70 was calculated as weight divided by height squared . Socioeconomic status during adulthood was defined by OSC of the participant 's main job from their career and dichotomised in the same way as their father 's OSC . For females , husband 's OSC was used if higher than their own . We selected a number of variables as effect modifiers a priori including sex , adulthood OSC and APOE e4 allele . Sex and adulthood OSC at age 70 were operationalised as above . Blood samples were taken during examination and participants were genotyped for APOE allele status using TaqMan technology at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core ( Deary et al . , 2012a ) . Participants were dichotomised into having at least one APOE e4 allele or having none . In addition to the variables above , we selected several variables to act as auxiliary variables in the imputation of missing data .
