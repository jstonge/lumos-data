Thus , the periods of observation for ever users of hormonal contraceptives in this age group had a higher proportion of information relating to current or recent use than those for ever users in a study recruiting older women , because many would have stopped using hormonal contraception many years previously . The Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer 's reanalysis of oral contraception data from 45 studies included women who were generally older than our cohort ( mean age of diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 56 years , with only 18 % of tumours diagnosed in women younger than 45 years ) . 4 The overall relative risk between ever and never users was 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.70 to 0.76 ) . The Collaborative Group 's analysis found that younger and premenopausal women seemed to have greater percentage reductions in risk of ovarian cancer per five years of oral contraceptive use . 4 However , after accounting for time since last use , no significant heterogeneity by menopausal status or age was seen , demonstrating that how recent a woman last used hormonal contraceptives was more important than the other two factors . Our slightly stronger reduced risk for any ovarian cancer among ever users of any hormonal contraception ( relative risk 0.66 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.58 to 0.76 ) ) was possibly due to 58 % of the total period of observation in ever users arising from current or recent use of combined oral contraceptives . Similar to the Collaborative Group 4 and other more recent investigations , [ 5][6][7][8][9 ] we found that the risk reductions among current users of any hormonal contraception got stronger with longer durations of use and persisted for a number of years after stopping use . The apparent loss of protection 10 years after stopping hormonal contraception could be due to the loss of biological effect ( assuming a causal association exists ) , or reduced statistical power to continue to observe a significant reduction due to the relatively small periods of observation ( 7 % of total person years for ever use ) .",389,233290880_15,

Emission and absorption spectroscopy studies were hence undertaken at a concentration of 50 μm in methanol or in aqueous solutions . In methanol , both complexes were highly soluble , and spectroscopically speaking , comparatively highenergy absorption ( 451 nm or lower ) and emission maxima ( 604 for [ 1]OAc and 556 and 591 nm for [ 2]OAc , see Figure 2a ; Table S6 , Supporting Information ) were found , which suggested an absence of metalophilic interaction and hence monomeric species . The distinct absorption of both isomers in MeOH can be attributed to their different HOMO - LUMO gap ( Figure S6a , Supporting Information ) , which critically depends on the proximity between the PtC bond and the non - bonding electron pair on the NMe bridge . [ 22 ] While in aerated methanol ( 50 μm ) , the luminescence of both complexes was weak , as characterized by low quantum yields ( below 0.0015 , Table S6 , Supporting Information ) ; in degassed methanol , their luminescent quantum yield increased ≈2 - 4 times ( still remaining lower than 0.005 ) , which demonstrated the triplet nature of the excited states of these monomers , but also suggested that O 2 is not so good at quenching the monomer emission . This observation was confirmed by the singlet oxygen generation quantum yield , which was moderate in aerated methanol solution ( φΔ = 0.44 for [ 1]OAc , 0.11 for [ 2]OAc ) . The photodynamic properties of both complexes were hence limited as monomers in methanol . In frozen MeOH / EtOH mixtures ( 77 K , Figure S8b , Supporting Information ) , the phosphorescence quantum yield was further increased by a factor > 20 for [ 1]OAc and > 100 for [ 2]OAc ( see Table S6 , Supporting Information ) , suggesting possible intermolecular ( triplet - triplet annihilation ) or intramolecular ( vibrational ) quenching routes at room temperature . Limited quenching by O 2 was confirmed by luminescent lifetime measurements ( Table S6 and Figure S8 , Supporting Information ): for both isomers , biexponential decay was observed , but considering the very low phosphorescence intensity , we interpret the short component τ 1 as a consequence of scattered light from the laser pulse ; the longer lifetime τ 2 , which we interpret as that of the Pt complex , increased by a factor of 2 - 4 upon degassing ( e.g. , from 150 to 602 ns for   for [ 2]OAc , see Table S6 , Supporting Information ) . According to TDDFT calculation on the monomeric cations [ 1 ] + and [ 2 ] + and to data above , the weak emission in methanol can be assigned to triplet ligand - to - ligand charge - transfer ( 3 LLCT ) transitions with a small triplet metal - to - ligand charge - transfer ( 3 MLCT ) character .",529,102487105_3,

Self - organizing tree analysis identified three clusters , which are numbered 1 to 3 . exhibit the highest affinity for this complex . In the absence of LMO2 , binding of TAL1 only remained at the strongest of these binding sites , albeit at a lower level , whereas the majority of TAL1 binding was found at novel binding sites . It has previously been shown that the interaction of LMO2 with TAL1 directly increases the stability of TAL1 / E2A heterodimer ( 57 ) . Experiments with TAL1 DNA - binding deficient mutants showed that DNA - binding activity of TAL1 was dispensable for specification of haematopoietic development ( 53 ) , only when the interaction of the TAL1 HLH domain with LMO2 was retained ( 57 ) . In addition , in the presence of LMO2 , TAL1 could associate with chromatin in the absence of its DNA binding domain , albeit with a lower affinity ( 58 ) . Our motif analysis of the threeway overlap of LMO2 , TAL1 and LDB1 ChIP indicated a very strong enrichment of GATA binding motifs ( Figure 5 ) . Taken together , this indicates that the interaction through LMO2 plays an important role in directing TAL1 to the correct binding sites , whereas without LMO2 , TAL1 has lower DNA binding activity and specificity . Comparison of our data to previously published LDB-1 ChIPseq data in Flk-1 + cells ( 28 ) and in Lin − bone marrow ( 59 ) showed that the overlap is particularly enriched for those LDB1 peaks that are part of the three - way overlap ( 83 % and 51 % of LMO2 , TAL1 and LDB1 ChIP peaks respectively ) . In addition , our and previous studies identify the same list of target genes ( e.g. Tal1 , Gata2 , Runx1 , Lmo2 , Runx2t2 and Sox7 ) . Intersecting the lists of differentially expressed genes reported by Mylona et al . indicated that the Ldb1 −/− was more similar to the Tal1 −/− , in line with the developmental block occurring earlier than in the Lmo2 −/− . Meta - analysis of the LMO2 complex binding sites identified an overrepresentation of regulatory elements important for haematopoietic development . These included transcription factor genes known to be important at the HB stage ( e.g. Fli1 ( 52,59 ) , Gata2 ( 32 ) , Erg ( 55 ) ) , genes that are important for the HE and endothelial - haematopoietic transition ( e.g. Gfi1 ( 60 ) ) , those with known haematopoietic stem cell function ( e.g. Lyl1 ( 61 ) , Stat3 ( 62 ) ) , and transcription factors with more lineage restricted functions ( e.g. Ebf1 ( 63 ) , Gata1 ( 64 ) , Nfe2 ( 65 ) ) .

As a result , the measurement in the l − final state is more sensitive to the sources that significantly alter the background contributions along with the signal , compared to the ones that impact the signal contribution only .

Quantification of intracellular lipid and extracellular calcified matrix deposition as proxies for adipogenesis and osteogenesis of MSCs revealed that the stiffness of Dex - TA tethered to cells played an essential role in their lineage commitment . Specifically , single - cellresolution analysis of MSC differentiation revealed that the adipogenic population fraction inversely correlated with microgel stiffness ( Figure 2q ) , while the osteogenic population fraction was characterized by a positive correlation with microgel stiffness ( Figure 2r ) . It is of note , that the single - cell - microgel platform offered unique opportunities toward handling , manipulation , and analysis of cells . For example , single - cellmicrogel analysis revealed the heterogeneity in lineage commitment within a population of differentiating stem cells under controlled chemical and mechanical stimuli . Furthermore , the single - cell microgels were demonstrated to be compatible with label - free analyses , which offered the opportunity of time - lapse monitoring of cell behavior in 3D while minimizing methodology - induced biases by omitting destructive analyses techniques .

648a441f1b9b678478ba1ee3,56562220,Advanced Energy Materials,77,"As PSCs have demonstrated a photoconversion energy as high as other commercial solar devices ( CdTe , CIGS , polycrystalline Si ) , one of the key challenges is achieving their long term stable performance when exposed to outdoor conditions . It can be seen from Table 3 and 5 that PSCs are fabricated with a wide variety of materials and design architectures , many of which are intrinsically unstable . It can also be noted that even the similar PSC architectures fabricated at different laboratories resulted in different stability , which is because the durability of these devices largely depends on the purity of starting materials , fabrication methods and conditions , and also the characteristics of the device interfaces . Unlike silicon and thin film solar cells where decades of research has brought them to deliver a stable performance over 20 years with negligible intrinsic degradation , these materials resembles OPVs where instability mostly arises from the materials components itself such as photo - oxidation , change in morphologies over time , and interfacial degradation . [ 273 ] We therefore believe that stability protocols of PSCs are more likely to follow the consensus being developed for OPVs [ 274 ] and DSCs [ 12,243 ] as the device degradation involves chemical modifications . For a detailed overview of the protocols that may be adopted while reporting stability of PSCs , we refer to the comprehensive reports highlighting various ISOS protocols to be adopted while measuring and reporting operational stability ( indoor and outdoor ) . [ 12,243,274 ] Although so far , not many reports have followed any standard protocol while reporting stability of PSCs , we recommend that the perovskite community should follow few considerations while reporting such data . Most importantly the overestimation in PV performance of PSCs due to anomalous hysteresis and their erroneous efficiency reporting ( missing IV data for reverse and forward scan , stabilized maximum power output and statistical analysis ) must be carefully looked at . [ 275 ] For a reliable device characterization , we suggest a measurement protocol developed by Zimmermann et al . [ 276 ] The protocol is derived from standard J - V measurements , power point tracking and stabilized PV parameters as well as characteristics extracted from time resolved current density - voltage measurements . The PSCs research community needs to report stabilized PV performance for both scan directions and preferably the J - V curves at various scan conditions ( delay time , scan rate etc . ) in order to provide a clearer picture of device performance . We recommend a recently published checklist while reporting the PV performance , [ 275 ] ( ii ) while reporting the stability of PSCs , the protocols such as those for dark or indoor testing ( ISOS - D-1 , shelf - life , ISOS - D-2 , high temperature storage , and ISOS - D-3 , damp heat ) or those for outdoor ( ISOS - O-1 - 3 ) [ 273 ] must be followed so that a consensus on the stability is made and a true picture of device performance is obtained .",532,52134732_16,

In the UK , the Prime Minister said antibody testing was a potential ' game - changer ' ( BBC 2020 ) . The presence of antibodies indicates an individual 's immune system has responded to the virus . Antibody tests differ from antigen tests that determine whether someone is currently infected . In the case of this virus , at the time this study was conducted in April / May 2020 , scientists and the public had little understanding of the longevity of antibodies , and whether they provided immunity to reinfection or transmission .

The commonly affected pathways were prominently plasma membrane - associated receptors and components , cytoskeleton and adhesion / junction - related proteins , ion channels / transporters and energy homeostasis ( Figure 3H ) . Considering the distinct physicochemical properties between AgNPs and GO , pathway analysis was further performed for the differentially methylated genes ( Figure 3I , J ) . A multitude of genes were found differentially methylated between AgNPs and GO in both A549 and 293 T cells , including genes responsible for gap junction ( e.g. , LPAR1 and GNAI3 ) [ 24 ] upon AgNPs exposure and genes encoding proteins involved in substance metabolism ( e.g. , PDE5A and GFPT1 ) [ 25 ] upon GO exposure . These differences between AgNPs and GO could be attributed to their distinct physicochemical properties and their different mode of interaction with cells including differential subcellular localization . [ 26][27][28][29 ] For example , AgNP dissolves ions , and Ag ions play a major role in AgNP - induced toxic effects ; [ 26 ] GO have different lateral sizes and surface functional groups and have strong association with biomolecules . [ 27 ] Therefore , we looked into the changes of 5 - mC levels responding to Ag ions and GO with different lateral sizes and surface modifications . Previous studies demonstrated that Ag particles and Ag ions simultaneously existed inside the cells with a release rate of Ag ions around 10 % . [ 28,30 ] Thus , Ag ions at 0.4 µg mL −1 were used to treat cells , and different from Ag particles , Ag ions did not induce a significant change in 5 - mC content in A549 , 293 T , and THP-1 cells ( Figure S14 , Supporting Information ) . In order to answer whether length / size contributes to the influence on DNA methylation induced by ENMs , we deliberately prepared an array of GO with different lateral size , i.e. , S - GO ( smallest ) , I - GO ( intermediate ) , and L - GO ( largest ) , as described in our recent report . [ 28 ] As shown in Figure S18 ( Supporting Information ) , no significant difference could be found among these sized - GO in increasing 5 - mC levels in A549 and 293 T cells . Furthermore , we scrutinized the effect of surface modification on DNA methy lation changes using GO - NH 2 and GO - PEG ( polyethylene glycol coated GO ) , as described in our recent study . [ 31 ] As shown in Figure S19 ( Supporting Information ) , compared with the parental GO and GO - NH 2 , GO - PEG induced a milder increase of 5 - mC levels in A549 and 293 T cells , in agreement with the greater biocompatibility of GO - PEG . [ 31 ] Taken together , these data revealed new insights into the structure - activity relationship for AgNPs and GO : Ag nanoparticles rather than dissolved Ag ions were responsible for the DNA methylation changes ; the surface activity of GO rather than its size played the major role in GO - induced DNA alternations . However , further studies should be considered to identify the physicochemical determinants and nanobio interactions ( e.g. , distinct subcellular localizations ) in inducing different signatures of DNA methylation for diverse ENMs in the future .",603,236219670_148,

Thus , while we have focussed our discussion on FIO modelling it is important for resource managers and policy makers to recognise that FIO models do not necessarily inform on specific pathogen behaviour . However , the nexus of FIO modelling and risk assessment is gaining significant momentum and the use of quantitative microbial risk assessment ( QMRA ) offers another modelling framework with which to estimate human infection risk from exposure to pathogen contaminated waters ( Soller et al . , 2015 ) . Benefits of FIO modelling will be further enhanced if the research community promotes a consistent message to model developers calling for any future model performance criteria to include , as a minimum , an uncertainty analysis of modelled predictions . Thus , the pedigree of uncertainty associated with model outputs needs to be transparent and included as standard in the reporting of any FIO modelling . There are mechanisms that can help deliver this drive for greater awareness of model uncertainty . For example , there are more frequent opportunities to promote knowledge exchange ( KE ) across the science - policy interface enabling scientists and policy - makers to debate the role and impact of model uncertainty . Research Councils in the UK , and in other nations too , are increasingly funding policy - placement opportunities whereby scientists are embedded within government departments thus providing an important route for aiding KE .

For the demonstration of the concept , we designed a genetically encoded NanoLuc - miniSOG platform , which can be delivered by a properly selected carrier to a tumor , and then triggered by the injection of furimazine substrate . To assess the efficiency of this pair , we expressed NanoLuc - miniSOG BRET - pair in breast ductal carcinoma BT-474 cancer cells and then examined its operation in vitro and in vivo . Spectroscopic characterization of BT-474 / NanoLuc - miniSOG cell line confirmed that BRET between NanoLuc and miniSOG    c Tumor - growth curves for control group ( mice treated with PBS only ) , as well as for groups carrying NanoLuc or NanoLuc - miniSOG LVs particles and treated with furimazine . Data are presented as the mean ± SD ( n = 6 ) . d In vivo bioimaging of animals bearing HER2 - positive tumors and injected i.t . with LVs - NanoLuc - miniSOG or LVs - NanoLuc . Three mice from each group on the 13th day after LVs injection are presented indeed occurs with the BRET ratio reaching 0.74 ± 0.05 ( Fig . 1d ) . The recorded ratio is in agreement with our previous data 23 , as well as with data for other BRET - based genetically encoded sensor systems 33,34 , confirming a high efficiency of the pair . We demonstrated by MTT assays that NanoLuc - miniSOG efficiently kills the cancer cells in the presence of furimazine ( Fig . 1e ) , while other tests confirmed that the endogenous bioluminescence can serve as a light source to activate the miniSOG for ROS generation ( Fig . 1f ) . Using the model of mice bearing engineered BT-474 cells expressing NanoLuc - miniSOG , we recorded TGI exceeded 72 % after the injection of furimazine without external light irradiation ( Fig . 2 ) . It means that the inhibition of tumor growth occurs due to BRET - induced PDT , although cytotoxicity of oxidized product of furimazine could also partially contribute to the cell death ( Fig . 2b ) . It is also important that bioluminescence imaging can be used in our case to assess BRET efficiency in vivo . The differences of the average luminescence signal with or without Rf in animals evidenced an efficient process of energy transfer from the donor ( oxidized NanoLuc luciferase - substrate ) to the acceptor ( miniSOG ) in the case of tumor Rf saturation ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Finally , genetic nature of proposed NanoLuc - miniSOG BRET - pair allowed us to use targeted viral system for gene delivery precisely into tumor ( Fig . 4 ) . Using HER2 - specific LVs carrying NanoLuc - miniSOG gene we achieved significant regression ( TGI 67 % ) of HER2 - positive xerograph tumor in the animal model , confirming a high efficiency of the proposed concept . We foresee several major advantages of the proposed concept of genetically encoded BRET - activated PDT over currently present chemically assembled BRET - based systems for PDT . First , the genetic nature of functional PDT elements provides an ideal spatial architecture of the BRET construct , conditioning optimal distance between the internal triggering source and the PS , which is obviously very difficult or impossible in the case of chemical assembling . Second , the proposed approach does not require any sophisticated and costly chemical conjugation protocols to generate functional BRET pair for PDT . Third , as showed in our studies , despite certain local toxic effects in organs due to furimazine injection , genetic encoding nature of synthesized protein complexes makes them safe and easily excretable from the organism , which is not the case for many chemically assembled structures . Finally , as probably the main advantage , the used principle of genetic encoding opens up novel appealing prospective for future improvements of PDT systems profiting from on genetic engineering approaches . In particular , the expression of used NanoLuc - miniSOG pair can be controlled on the genetic level by properly designed promoters ( e.g. , telomerase promoters ) , which are specific to some tumors . In addition , by fusing with a well - known protein localization motif ( nuclear , membrane , mitochondrial ) or a whole protein , the genetically encoded pair can be easily directed to any cell compartment ( or even sub - compartment ) . Furthermore , the use of different targeting molecules in the composition of lentiviruses or other carriers renders possible an easy re - direction of a genetically encoded BRET - activated system on any tumor type , while the therapeutic action will address not only the primary tumor , but also its metastasis distributed in the organism . Thus , the employment of genetically encoded constructs provides novel opportunities to direct BRETinduced generation of active forms of oxygen to different cellular compartments or particular cell lines , which is hardly possible with chemically assembled BRET systems .",891,174798322_25,

Any experimental activity ( including but not limited to publication ) that involves preferentially following up on one 's most statistically promising initial results presents the same challenge . For example , a standard study design in genetics is to scan the genome , one position at a time , for statistical evidence of a genetic variant with an effect on some phenotype in one or more families , in order to find the best - supported genomic position ; and then to follow up with additional data , e.g. , using a new set of families , in order to corroborate the result at that position . This procedure seems scientifically unassailable , but any attempt at evidence amalgamation across the two stages of the study violates the same statistical assumption as does publication bias . When following up on our most promising findings , we can expect the p value to regress to the mean regardless of whether the evidence is going up or down , by virtue of having selected a location for follow - up on the basis of a notably small p value .",200,23663578_49,

In terms of the generalizability of our research - it was our primary focus to obtain an insightful and rich understanding of ethical behavior in family firms . Therefore , we started with a well - selected data set , which is in line with current standards ( e.g. , Salvato and Corbetta 2013 ) . However , we acknowledge the interviews conducted with a sample of 19 family firm employees allow only limited interpretations of the connection between identity and ethical behavior . Given that our study is limited to German family firms , our findings could be subject to bias due to the single - nation focus . Each nationality and culture has different values , and individuals ' ethical awareness could be influenced by their cultural background . To gain a more detailed understanding , we suggest taking our research as a basis to explore further the family firm 's unique characteristics and ethical behavior against other cultural settings . For instance ,   has recently revealed contradictions between family and external expectations of Corporate Social Responsibility reporting measures in Latin American family businesses . From an ethics perspective , we did not assess examples of ( un)ethical behavior . An ( objective ) assessment and evaluation of actual ( un)ethical behavior is an important next step to interpret whether or not the approach to an ethical situation is congruent with the underlying value system . We also call for future research to examine the temporal dimension of identification , an important facet which is rarely studied . As our results show , identification is not static but dynamic in nature . Identification processes involve many aspects , both on the individual and organizational level . Identifying with an organization and its values is an ongoing journey for employees . Some parts of an individual 's identity even evolve along with the sense of belonging to an organization , which needs further investigation ( Knapp et al . 2013;Kreiner et al . 2006 ) .",361,235187305_17,

648a31c51b9b6784785ef6be,237576621,Social Science & Medicine,42,"This study is not without limitations . First of all , data collection started about a month before any COVID-19 vaccine was officially approved , that is , in a period in which accurate information was not available on the characteristics of the candidate vaccines , in particular about their efficacy , safety , and the possible side effects . With the start of the vaccination campaign , the intention to get vaccinated may likely have changed in light of the clearer information about the vaccines , the experiences of people who have already received them , and , not less importantly , government decisions and the daily news broadcast by the media . As specified above , the data on the time course of the vaccination campaign in Italy are in line with those of the neighbouring countries of the EU ( around 60 % of fully vaccinated people ) . However , the percentage of people still hesitant about the vaccine should not be underestimated , particularly in the older age groups ( e.g. , over 60s and 70s ) , where there is currently the lowest adhesion to vaccines ( Italian Ministry of Health , 2021b ) . For this reason , further studies are needed to verify whether the type of persuasive message that we have identified as the most effective in promoting intention to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine also works in increasing intention to get the currently approved vaccines and the consequent behaviour and its impact on different socio - demographic groups . Secondly , since we used a convenience sample recruited by advertising the study through various online channels ( e.g. , Facebook groups ) , we can not conclude that our results are generalisable to the general population and , above all , that participants did not already have high levels of vaccination intention . However , the heterogeneity of participants in terms of socio - demographic characteristics may have partially reduced this bias . Thirdly , although in the literature there is no convincing evidence that affective attitudeunlike anticipated affective reactionscan predict vaccination intention , future studies with larger samples could simultaneously manipulate both components of the attitude ( cognitive vs affective ) plus anticipated affective reactions to clarify better if and how these processes are mutually exclusive in the context of the decision - making process related to COVID-19 vaccination . In addition , it should be noted that we have not focused on all the variables of the TPB model but only on attitude and intention . Future studies should also consider , for example , the possible effect of subjective norms on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID , since the literature shows that subjective norms , after attitude , are the strongest predictors of vaccination intentions ( e.g. , Askelson et al . , 2010 ) . Injunctive norms , i.e. what significant others ( family , friends ) think the person should do ( to get vaccinated or not ) , and descriptive norms , i.e. what they do themselves ( they intend to get vaccinated or not ) , are both aspects that could have a substantial impact on the decision to get vaccinated , especially in consideration of the context of uncertainty ( e.g. , doubts about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines ) in which this decision is taken . Furthermore , considering that many countries are starting to vaccinate or consider vaccinating children and young people , studying the impact of social influences is even more relevant . Indeed , younger people 's attitudes toward vaccines appear to be heavily influenced by social norms ( Rambout et al . , 2014 ) ; in this perspective , learning that most people significant to them ( e.g. , parents or friends ) get vaccinated can represent , for the youngest , an important motivational factor .",655,256000583_19,

The meta - atoms in the EOD metagratings were formed by uniformly sized plasmonic nanorods , and the local periodicity between the meta - atoms determines a discrete set of diffraction channels . Based on EOD 17,19,47 , an architecture , in which plasmonic nanorods were placed on top of a dielectric spacer with a metallic background , was employed to funnel the impinging light into the desired diffraction channel with near - unity efficiency . By further continuously displacing the nanorod within each unit cell according to the strategy of a detour phase 48 , customized phase profiles for molding arbitrary wavefronts of light can be generated . Because the phase modulation rule for a EOD metagrating is intrinsically independent of the incident angles and wavelengths , the wavefront shaping capabilities are robust for a broad bandwidth and for an extremely large range of incident angles ( close to the grazing incidence ) . Our proposed EOD metagrating does not rely on complicated and asymmetric meta - atom inclusions [ 49][50][51][52][53][54 ] and thus significantly simplifies the metasurface design procedures and lowers the fabrication demand , which is highly desirable for various holographic applications , including high - fidelity three - dimensional displays , data encryption , and anti - counterfeiting .

The tip of SL5 contains mainly unreactive nucleotides , possibly indicating kissing - loop interactions involved in dimer initiation . Nucleotides that were predicted to be base - paired in SL1 were unreactive to 1M7 , with the exception of A131 . As the A residue 3 0 of this was predicted to be bulged , and is unreactive , it is likely that the bulge forms consistently at A131 and not at A132 ( shown in Figure 2 ) .

We were also limited by the numbers available for the analysis sample due to the criteria for eligibility being based on continued lifetime residence in a small geographic area . It was necessary to dichotomise OSC as to provide greater statistical power for stratified models ( i.e. to keep cell sizes to an appropriate size ) . This dichotomisation was also appropriate when this variable was used as a covariate , as previous research found that significant differences in health outcomes were only found between "" professional or managerial occupations "" compared to the rest ( Gale et al . , 2016 ) . We dichotomised other covariates ( e.g. smoking status ) as they were not recorded in the same way for childhood and adulthood and therefore dichotomisation was used to aid interpretation of change over time . The analysis sample was broadly similar in terms of selected characteristics compared with the full cohort at age 70 , but selection bias may have caused a higher number of participants from lower socioeconomic groups being included . The issue of selection bias was partly addressed by running the sensitivity analysis using a sample with different assumptions . For addresses within the Edinburgh area , the precision of the addresses supplied varied and therefore , for a small number of addresses that did not have a house number , the error between actual participant residence and geocoded address was larger as we took the centre of their street . In addition , by geocoding using contemporary sources , we have assumed that the street layout was the same as it is today for the majority of the addresses , with only minor changes to the street content . However we acknowledge that these small changes could have affected the precision of the park exposure estimate for the earlier time periods . Given that we were geocoding a relatively small number of addresses , we were able to employ a system to detect information lost compared with what was supplied , so that if the results were unsatisfactory they would be geocoded manually . This ensured that addresses that had changed significantly ( e.g. demolished ) would be geocoded to the same accuracy as those that were able to be geocoded with contemporary sources ( < 3 m ) .

In this study , we propose a new unsupervised approach for testing differential methylation in regions against continuous phenotype such as age , tumor size or marker protein concentrations . Note that in the proposed mixed effects model ( Supplementary Text , Section 1 ) , the phenotype variable is included as an independent variable and the methylation values as the outcome variable . Therefore , no distributional assumptions ( e.g. normal distribution ) are made for the continuous phenotypes . Table 1 lists several previously proposed unsupervised methods . A challenge with unsupervised approaches is their lack of specificity . Unlike gene expression data , the regional boundary of DNA methylation is often not well defined . Therefore , currently available approaches that summarize methylation levels in a region using mean or median methylation levels of the CpGs within the region may have results that vary depending on the boundaries of the region . In addition , when testing associations between phenotype and the summarized methylation levels in a genomic region , the spatial correlations between CpG sites within the region is ignored .",226,255441206_447,

In turn , the presentation of neo - antigens generated by the mutanome in combination with immune system activation by checkpoint blockade can distinguish normal from tumor tissue . Based on studies demonstrating a relationship between TMB and immunotherapy response ( i.e. , the higher the TMB , the greater the response rate ) and between other gene alterations , such as PDL1 amplification and response , genomics is directly relevant to selecting patients for immune checkpoint blockade . 17,43 Furthermore , the FDA has approved the immune checkpoint inhibitor , pembrolizumab , for any solid tumor with alterations in DNA mismatch repair pathway genes ( e.g. ,MSH2 , MSH6 , MLH1 , PMS2 ) due to associated large increases in TMB . 35 Moreover , TMB increases correlate with a higher neoantigen load based upon somatic mutation data from the TCGA . 44 In turn , these would be expected to be more immunogenic and therefore responsive to immunotherapy . 17 In a retrospective fashion that was unblinded to outcomes , we developed an alternative approach for scoring immune checkpoint blockade matches . In a histology agnostic fashion , we previously reported objective response rates ( ORR , % ) for patients receiving immunotherapy in the setting of low , intermediate , and high TMB . 17 Therefore , we adopted these ORRs as the matching scores for intermediate TMB ( given under the I - PREDICT protocol ( PFS2 ) ; ( iii ) PFS2 versus PFS1 ( immediate prior line of therapy using patients as their own control ) , 7,46 ; ( iv ) percent of patients with a PFS2 / PFS1 ratio ≥1.3 ; 7 and ( v ) overall survival ( OS ) .

Hence the existing shift between each adjacent dashed and full line represents the small change in the sterile neutrino component , proportional to cos 2 α , resulting from introducing in the scheme aν X component up to its 95 % CL upper bound . This shows that the possible sterile neutrino flux is hardly sensitive to the presence of antineutrinos , a fact whose origin becomes clear on examination of the denominator in eq.(2.13 ): the multiplier of sin 2 α is very close to unity for any value of ψ owing to the fact thatr d ≃ 1 . From fig.3 it is also seen that in the absence ofν x ( x = e , sin 2 ψ = 1 ) the fraction of solar neutrinos oscillating to active ones is greater than 0.59 ( SNO II ) and 0.63 ( SNO I ) at 2σ of the non - ν e flux .

On all metrics , DCA - GMM shows a phase transition property , i.e. , the algorithm will overwhelmingly success below a curve of noise and variance level . This property verifies the robustness of DCA - GMM to data noise and variance within a cluster . In addition , when increasing the number of sub - problems ( layers from bottom to top ) , the accuracy of DCA - GMM soon saturates on a value close to 1 , this indicates that a small number of sub - problems in DCA - GMM is sufficient to produce a promising clustering result , which is highly preferred in practice . Moreover , the time cost of DCA - GMM is significantly small and thus exhibits its competitive efficiency . Furthermore , error is more robust to data noise than accuracy , because most false anchors detected in the noise case are close to the true ones , which leads to small error .

First , the research revealed high levels of turbulence among share households , with 39 % reporting that either they or another member of their household had moved homes between April and June 2020 . That figure is in comparison to the 14 % of Australians and 35 % of Australian renters that move each year on average ( Australian Bureau of Statistics , 2016 ) . Our data point to a broad range of reasons for these movements , including caring responsibilities ; work opportunities ; returning to family homes ; moving to reduce housing costs when housemates moved out ; leaving to avoid mounting tensions and conflict between housemates ; and returning to countries or states of origin before borders closed . These movements , mostly instigated by the pandemic , represent a dramatic pattern of migration among this cohort and additional research is needed to track the short and long - term impacts of these movements . The geographic clustering of share houses , and low - income rental households more generally , is likely to cause clusters of vacant homes and/or clusters of households in high housing stress in the short to medium term . Similarly , given that 16 % of respondents were living in overcrowded households and 24 % reported feeling stressed by their lack of control over their domestic space , there are clear implications for greater risk of virus transmission in crowded spaces and mental health outcomes for households coping with spatial and interpersonal conflicts . Such challenges are likely to be common to share households internationally .",284,231690061_51,

To optimize the performance of the proposed DiLFM , we thoroughly discuss the appearance and mechanism of three different kinds of LFM reconstruction artifacts and intake them all into a dictionary patching model to correct them . Furthermore , the proposed dictionary patching increases the reconstruction resolution and contrast by supplying high - resolution and high - contrast information from the training stage . We validate our DiLFM through In the functional imaging experiment , we show DiLFM can discover two times more neurons with improved ΔF / F and reduced artifacts disturbance with low light dosage . We hope the scheme can help LFM become a promising and reliable tool for high - speed imaging biological tissues in 3D. The proposed DiLFM achieves superior performance compared to traditional LFM but with full advantages of LFM in other aspects . For example , the volume acquisition rate of DiLFM is independent of the size of the sample and only limited by camera frame rate , compared to other 3D imaging technology . Introducing the dictionary only affects the downstream data processing speed without any sacrifice of capturing rate . It is straightforward to extend DiLFM to a larger FOV or a compact head - mounted LFM 27 . Furthermore , by introducing photon - scattering models into dictionary priors 34 , it is possible to exceed the depthpenetration limitation of DiLFM in in vivo mouse - brain imaging 23 . Borrowing the thoughts from DiLFM of using the versatile dictionary to adopt different imaging environments , other deconvolution energized volumetric imaging methods 22,35 can also use such a prior for better performance in various applications .",308,218912587_33,

The incessant and elevated presence in proinflammatory cytokines CINC-1 , CINC-2 , CINC-3 , LIX , and IL-6 , being crucial neutrophil traffickers , cause exacerbated levels of neutrophil incidence , resulting in further tissue damage [ 27,[41][42][43 ] . Unlike FPF - treated wounds , control animals exhibited a significant increase in neutrophil chemoattractants that correlated with the upsurge in neutrophils to the wound bed ( Figure 6B ) . Downregulation of genes , including Ccl12 , Cxcl1 , Cxcl3 , IL-1β , IL-6 , Ptgs2 , and TNF , that contribute to inflammatory responses were observed in FPF - treated animals [ 44][45][46][47 ] . Furthermore , adhesion molecules L - selectin and JAM - A that are critical in neutrophil migration and activation were reduced upon FPF treatment .

We added other 4 provincial capital cities ( Xining , Hohhot , Urumqi , Yinchuan ) , which were not included in this ranking list of First - tier , New First - tier , and Second - tier cities . Due to lacking data in the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases or the daily population inflow and outflow indexes of some Second - tier cities , the study areas were limited to 43 major cities ( including Wuhan ) across China , which were the industrial , financial , and commercial hearts of China .

648a60bd1b9b6784787a0342,4788100,Nucleic Acids Research,45,"We speculate that the half - parS sequences scattered across the genome may play a role in concentrating ParB molecules on the nucleoid . The interaction of ParB with multiple sites combined with the interactions between ParB molecules could provide a scaffold for chromosome compaction and affect DNA topology , possibly playing a role in modulation of gene expression . Our earlier transcriptomic analysis of P. aeruginosa parB null mutant versus WT indicated altered expression of 1166 genes ( 60 ) . A large fraction of these genes seemed to be involved in the stress response due to disturbances in chromosome segregation ( 85 ) . A complementary study with a strain showing 5 - fold overproduction of ParB ( ParB+++ ) , a ParB excess leading to no visible changes in growth rate or genome segregation , revealed altered expression of 211 loci ( 65 ) . The present ChIP - seq data suggest that the ParB - DNA binding relies on the presence of specific sequence(s ) . A comparison of the distribution of the analyzed variants of the parS half - site with the transcriptional organization of the genome shows that in PAO1 these sequences are mainly intragenic ( GTTCCAC--92 % , GTTTCAC--76 % , GCTCCAC--89 % , GTTCCAT--94 % , GATCCAC--93 % and GTTTCAT--84 % ) , which suggests their roughly random distribution between coding and non - coding sequences ( genes make up 90 % of the PAO1 genome ) . The loci with expression affected by ParB deficiency are putatively expressed from 853 promoters . Only 113 of these promoters contain one of the six indicated sequences . Similarly , the 211 loci affected by ParB overproduction are expressed from 130 promoters only 28 of which contain one of the motifs . Whereas ParB binding to the palindromic parS3 and parS4 is responsible for the repression of PA0011p and PA0013p , respectively ( 65 ) , the low correlation between the ParB - dependent changes in expression and the presence of half - parS sequences in the promoters of other genes suggests that their ParB - dependent regulation does not rely solely on a direct ParB - promoter interaction . The mechanism linking ParB and gene expression regulation in P. aeruginosa requires further studies .",381,228885500_62,

The experimental B0 rotational constants have been corrected to equilibrium geometry using theoretically computed differences ( Be - B0 ) at the DFT level and VPT2 theory as implemented in Gaussian program package .

648a3a111b9b6784788b99db,16498115,Synthese,8,"One of the most remarkable facts about human languages is that children learn them in a short period of time . Children are able to learn very rapidly from the input data of the language they hear to a full command of that language . This is a remarkable fact , because children generally get very little explicit instruction about how language can and should be used . In order to explain how children can become fluent speakers , they have to be able to form a ' model ' of the linguistic environment that not only makes grammaticality judgments about sentences they actually heard , but also about ( many more ) ones that they never heard before . In the fifties , Chomsky ( 1957 ) argued quite forcefully that the behavoristic learning theory that was popular at that timeassuming that people start out as a tabula rasa , and making use only of simple association and blind induction -could not account for this . 1,2 Somewhat later , this argument was backed up by Gold 's ( 1967 ) results in formal learning theory . Stating it very sloppily , Gold proved that learning , or identifying , an arbitrary selected language among a collection of languages by ' natural ' 3 data is impossible in the complete absence of prior information . The arguments of Chomsky and the results of Gold ( and later results in learning theory ) are powerful , clear , and ( should be ) uncontroversial .

U2 - OS cells were treated with nonspecific control siRNAs or with specific siRNAs to knockdown the protein level of BRCA1 and the ability of YFPtagged DNA - PKcs to localize to DSBs was assessed in S and non - S phase cells . YFP - tagged DNA - PKcs quickly localized to the laser - generated DSBs and its overall dynamics were similar in S and non - S phase cells , which were treated with either non - specific siRNAs or BRCA1 siRNAs ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) .

However , redder stars can also show significant astrometric noise independent of binarity ( e.g. , Thao et al . 2020 ) .

At large pseudorapidities , corresponding to smaller x 2 , gluons become dominant . As discussed in [ 45 ] , hadron production at , say , 1.5 GeV is biased to partons at p T ∼ 3 GeV. Since x 2 = p T √ s ( e −η + e −y 2 ) , small values of x 2 of the order 0.001 , start to play a role at η = 3 . Integration over y 2 ( or x 2 ) however , smears the effects of the nuclear modifications which is why we do not see a larger change in R DAu with the stronger gluon shadowing example considered . As shown in Ref . [ 42 ] , even more dramatic small - x behaviour of gluons , such as suggested in [ 21,43,12 ] , would obviously be needed to account for the BRAHMS data . Whether gluons with such shadowing , supplemented perhaps with stronger shadowing for the sea quarks as well , would maintain the good global fit to the DIS and DY data now obtained , remains to be seen . At the same time , dependence of the fragmentation functions on the hadron charge ( negatives instead of the average h + + h − ) , should be studied in more detail within a consistent DGLAP framework .",277,210943398_1,

One advantage of this action is government revenue from non - recyclable waste , which can offset some of the costs associated with waste management . On the other hand , leaving infectious waste from COVID-19 at the disposal site can cause serious health and environmental problems . By burning this waste in incinerators , in addition to repelling potential viruses , the energy can be produced . ii . Researchers have ignored waste collection programs as Bi - level in the literature , mainly focusing only on reducing the length of transportation paths and reducing costs . Therefore , this paper proposes a Bi - level programming problem for waste collection and transportation planning in which the concern of the governments for economy and environment is considered as a leader and the contractor 's concern as a social concern is considered as a follower . This paper uses hybrid mathematical modelling with a Bi - level model approach ( leader - follower ) to address two important issues . To the best of our knowledge , few studies have used hybrid mathematical modelling with a Bi - level model approach ( leader - follower ) to improve waste management during a pandemic . iii .

We consider the potential uncertainty of the COVID-19 outbreak by considering different scenarios . According to our research , no research has considered the virus outbreak scenarios in waste planning problems , and this research is unique .

In addition to bremsstrahlung , those electrons can cause K - shell ionization of ambient Fe atoms and can emit the Kα line at 6.4 keV ( Dogiel et al . 2011;Nobukawa et al . 2018;Okon et al . 2018;Saji et al . 2018 ) . Nonthermal bremsstrahlung in the hard Xray band , therefore , should always be accompanied by the neutral Fe Kα line . The equivalent width ( EW ) of the line with respect to the nonthermal bremsstrahlung component is EW 400 eV if the Fe abundance is consistent with solar ( Dogiel et al . 2011 ) . By extrapolating the power law to lower energies and assuming an emission line at 6.4 keV with EW = 400 eV , we found that NuSTAR can not detect the line because of the bright thermal emission . Analyzing the NuSTAR data below 9 keV , we indeed did not see any hints of a line structure at 6.4 keV. It is of interest to search for the line in data taken with charge - coupled device cameras on board other operating observatories , which have better energy resolution at that energy . Eventually , X - ray microcalorimeters on board future X - ray astronomy satellites such as XRISM ( formerly known as XARM ) and Athena can easily detect the line . Detection of the neutral Fe Kα line as well as its EW with respect to the continuum detected by NuSTAR will help us confirm the radiation mechanism of the hard X - ray emission and will provide us with further information about the spectra of sub - relativistic particles accelerated in this SNR .",314,233029680_173,

When we use this as a measure , dependency has fallen by one third over the past four decades ( fig 3 ⇓ ) . Looking into the future , the old age dependency ratio will continue to rise , even if we adjust for the planned changes in the state pension age . However , the real elderly dependency ratio is set to fall further , stabilise for several years then gradually increase , although at no point through to 2050 will it regain the levels experienced for most of the last century . Moreover , our projection is a conservative one , since we have held employment rates constant over time , when they are likely to increase because of the rise in the state pension age , disincentives to early retirement , and further progress on sex equality . It is thus probable that our ratio will stabilise near its current level . Figure 4 ⇓ shows how our new measure and the conventional old age dependency ratio compare over the past half century for several countries . While the old age dependency ratio rises substantially everywhere , the real elderly dependency ratio falls in most countries . In Germany and Italy the real elderly dependency ratio has been almost flat for two decades because of slower growth in employment and lower birth rates than in other countries . Immigration has played an important role in depressing the real elderly dependency ratio by raising employment rates . Conversely Japan , with relatively low birth rates , immigration , and female labour force participation , has seen its ratio rise rapidly .

648a42941b9b678478a590fe,249224328,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,22,"The analysis of single cells is a growing research field in many disciplines , including toxicology , medical diagnosis , drug and cancer research , and metallomics . Numerous analytical ICP - MS - based methods were developed or improved , to allow the analysis of individual cells and their cellular compartments [ 102][103][104 ] . Analysis of individual cells provides highly valuable information on cell - to - cell variance , especially within an isogenic cell population . Cells display significant heterogeneity in size , individual physiological status , or access to nutrients , and specifically drugs , which can lead to varying metal uptake rates and metal concentrations , which is important in metal drug research and their clinical application [ 105 ] . To understand the biochemical status of the entire cell population under consideration , the biology of individual cells needs to be studied [ 106 ] . In element - related single cell analysis , two different concepts of sample introduction to ICP - MS are mainly applied today . The most common concept of single cell ICP - MS ( SC - ICP - MS ) is based on the nebulization of a cell suspension , with direct rapid analysis of individual cells for their metal content . Using pneumatic nebulization for sample introduction into the ICP - MS is often used to directly measure cell parameters ( especially biomarkers ) in a large number of cells in a very short time ( 1000 or more cell events in 1 s ) . Contrary to conventional ICP - MS , which looks at a continuous signal , SP - ICP - MS looks at discrete signals , where a cell suspension is nebulized through a dedicated introduction system , managing each cell entering the plasma one after the other . Maintaining the critical balance between efficient separation of the cells into individual cells ( no clustering ) through well - controlled sample buffer conditions on the one hand , and avoiding cell bursting on the other hand , is an extremely important prerequisite during sample preparation and cell nebulization for SC - ICP - MS . Cell burst results in increased background continuous element signal ( such as in conventional ICP - MS ) , and the aimed discrete signals per cell are lost . For minimizing coincidence of multiple cells entering the plasma , the cell concentration should be around 100,000 cells / mL. In the ICP - plasma , each single cell is ionized and the resulting ion burst from the intrinsic metal is detected by the ICP - MS as a sharp , very short signal spike [ 107 ] . In this optimal situation , one cell yields one ion burst , with the intensity of the resulting signal being related to the size of a cell ( nm ) , and the number of pulses being related to the cell concentration ( part / mL ) . Thus , on the instrumental side , for successful SP - ICP - MS , a rapid , continuous measurement is mandatory , having the ability to monitor and quantify discrete , very short pulses of positively charged ions in a time - resolved manner , using microsecond data acquisition rates [ 107 ] . Such short dwell time not only ensures that the spike signals relate just to one cell , but additionally achieves a higher signal - to - noise ratio [ 108 ] . The first successful application of this approach of direct - label - free analysis of single cells by ICP - MS was reported by Houk 's group in 2005 [ 109 ] . They measured the signal of uranium incorporated intrinsically in Bacillus subtilis , using a micro - concentric nebulizer . At the beginning of SC - ICP - MS , the main research focus was about suitable systems for the introduction of intact single cells into ICP - MS . As an example , Verboket et al . present a microfluidic system for droplet generation , and direct injection of cell suspensions into the ICP - MS as a technical improvement for sample introduction [ 110 ] . In the same year , the authors around Bodenmiller introduced a sophisticated method for increasing detection sensitivity and specificity for particular cellular compounds , through the use of antibodies tagged with rare metals . Multi - element scanning in respectively treated cells allows for the acquiring of high - dimensional parameters of cell components tagged by those antibodies / metals [ 111,112 ] .",769,233664324_88,

This method yields giant unilamellar vesicles ( 2 - 50 µm in diameter ) as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) . The membrane thickness ( 3.7 ± 0.4 nm ) was determined by analysis of deposited vesicles in atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information ) . The height and phase images by AFM revealed completely homogeneous membranes for all studied ratios of JD PG : JD PC , demonstrating that both JDs homogeneously mix in any ratio of concentrations ( Figure 3a ) . Such mixing is a sine qua non condition for the continuous tuning of interactions . We determined the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions ( Figure S5 , Supporting Information ) for JD and lipid membranes by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( Figure 3b ) . The latter membranes consist of DOPC / DOPG , which are a model of E. coli membranes . Fast dynamics were observed for both systems in agreement with being above their melting temperature ( −14 and −17 ° C for JD PC and JD PG , respectively ) . The diffusion coefficients ( D ) were maximal for supported bilayers of the pure JD PC or DOPC ( 2.7 ± 0.8 µm 2 s −1 and 2.5 ± 1.8 µm 2 s -1 , respectively ) and decreased monotonically with increasing ratio ( 10 - 40 mol% ) of the negatively charged functional components . This trend may be associated with a stronger association of the negatively charged amphiphiles with the underlying substrate and a concomitant reduction of their mobility . However , even the lowest diffusion coefficients are ≈10 - 1000 times higher than for polymersomes . [ 10a,11b,18 ] The drastic difference between the D of polymersomes and the ones liposomes and dendrimersomes stems from their completely different molecular arrangement .   In polymersomes , D is controlled by the motion of the entangled hydrophobic blocks that follow either the Rouse or reptation models . [ 10a ] Such motion is much slower and rapidly decreases with molecular weight . On the other hand , the hydrophobic tails in lipids or dendrimersomes are not entangled , thus the motion only requires to exchange positions and is therefore much faster . The temperature stability of DSs and liposomes was assessed by CLSM and fluorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS ) ( Figure 3c ) . Addition of Co 2 + to calcein - filled DSs did not change the fluorescence intensity in the vesicle lumen demonstrating impermeability of the membrane to ions . Contrarily , a decrease in fluorescence was observed for liposomes indicating a permeable membrane .

Differences between HSA and BSA are of particular interest ; glycation of HSA dramatically reduces its antioxidant activity , while glycation of BSA somewhat enhances its antioxidant properties . These data correlate with the results of computational experiments aimed at studying the effects of the redox status of HSA and BSA on their binding and esterase activities towards paraoxon [ 60,61 ] . From an evolutionary and comparative biochemistry / physiology point of view , the following fact seems to be important : the concentration of glucose in the blood plasma of birds is 1.5 - 2 times higher than in mammals of a similar mass ( so - called benign hyperglycemia ) , but avian albumin ( for example , CSA - Chicken Serum Albumin ) gets glycated to a lesser extent than BSA , even when albumins have been exposed to increasing glucose concentrations of up to 500 mM in in vitro experiments [ 171 ] . Analysis of protein structures suggests that the relative resistance of CSA to glycation may be associated with fewer lysine residues and variations in protein folding that protect lysine residues from interacting with plasma glucose . Comparative analysis of reconstructed albumin sequences indicates that the ancestors of birds had 6 - 8 fewer lysine residues in the albumin molecule compared to mammalian albumin [ 171 ] . Benign hyperglycemia is a common physiological feature of birds , and the development of mechanisms to resist albumin glycation is apparently inextricably linked with their evolution . It is believed that the development of benign hyperglycemia in birds coincided with a radical restructuring of their genome , which resulted in the loss of important genes , including the gene encoding GLUT4 , a transporter responsible for insulin - dependent glucose transport in insulin - sensitive cells of other vertebrates . This loss appears to have led to the remodeling of the insulin - dependent signaling pathway in avian tissues [ 172 ] .",398,53101046_10,

With periodic single - sideband ( SSB ) modulation , an LFM optical carrier is generated to carry a 4 - level pulse amplitude - modulation ( PAM4 ) signal and acts as a sensing probe to capture vibrations along the fibre . In the experiments , 56 Gbit / s PAM4 signal transmissions and distributed vibration measurements are simultaneously implemented in a 24.5 km fibre . Benefiting from the effective suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering ( SBS ) by the LFM optical carrier , the launching power and self - phase modulation ( SPM ) are significantly enhanced , thereby mitigating chromatic dispersion ( CD)-induced power fading and improving the transmission performance . The experimental results show that the optimal launching power is improved by 7 dB in comparison with the conventional PAM4 signal transmission . By employing the respective optimal launching powers in both schemes , the proposed scheme achieves an~1.3 dB performance improvement at the 7 % forward error correction ( FEC ) threshold ( BER = 3.8 × 10 −3 ) . In the ISAC - OF , only the carrier - corresponding RBS light is detected to retrieve the sensing information . By demodulating the phase , vibrations along a 24.5 km fibre are accurately retrieved with 4 m spatial resolution ( SR ) , 4.32 - nε/ ffiffiffiffiffiffi Hz p strain resolution , and an effective sampling rate in excess of 42 kHz . More importantly , the sensing accuracy is only reduced by~1.25 dB compared with the conventional LFM - based Φ - OTDR , with little impact on sensing performance .

Furthermore , preventing ENaC degradation by phosphorylation of NEDD4L [ 18 ] and channel activation by direct phosphorylation [ 19][20][21 ] leads to an increased ENaC open probability [ 19,20 ] . It was previously shown that AKT increases ENaC activity by phosphorylation of NEDD4L , thereby reducing the affinity of NEDD4L to ENaC [ 18 ] . To examine possible signaling pathways stimulated by BSA , Western blots determined phosphorylation of several kinases involved in regulating ENaC activity . Phosphorylation of AKT was significantly higher after BSA treatment . Moreover , phosphorylation of NDRG1 was significantly increased by BSA , indicating elevated SGK1 activity . In contrast , phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L was not altered by BSA . Taken together , these data suggest a stimulation of the PI3K / AKT / SGK1 pathway induced by BSA . Whether activation of this pathway is responsible for the stimulation of Na + transport by BSA was analyzed in Ussing chambers . Inhibition of the PI3 K completely abolished the stimulating effect of BSA on epithelial Na + transport and barrier integrity . These measurements confirmed that BSA stimulated epithelial Na + transport and barrier integrity by activating the PI3K / AKT / SGK1 pathway .

Measuring the quality of urban green space is a tedious process . Observational approaches are often criticized since they require extensive repeat measurements at the same location , incurring considerable time and cost expenditures . Moreover , collected data quickly become outdated , making progress out of reach [ 2 ] . Since green space can be a powerful ecological instrument and a possible way to improve public health , city planners , urban designers , policymakers , and estate managers must maximize opportunities to apply greening strategies .

Ethics , traditions , and social norms are parts of nonmaterial culture , whereas technology and equipment are parts of material culture ( Roberts and Wasieleski 2012 ) . Although either culture can advance faster than the other , material culture frequently accumulates and progresses much more swiftly because of its exponential speed of evolution , unlike nonmaterial culture , the pace of which has remained virtually constant ( Brinkman and Brinkman 1997 ) . For instance , when a novel technology is introduced to society , material culture advances whereas nonmaterial culture stays put , thereby generating a cultural lag , whose benefits and drawbacks can be determined only after the dissemination of the technology . The rules and regulations can then be proposed as social adjustments to minimize the cultural lag in accordance with social consensus . Different parts of a society are disjointed because of the cultural lag and adjustments among them are required for social stability .",441,237292347_35,

This result has been reproduced several times , always obtaining the same hydrogenation pattern . As a result of the partial hydrogenation , the fullerene cage experiences a strong distortion , arising from the sp 2 to sp 3 hybridization change of the hydrogenated sixmembered rings .

Recall that the approximated posterior q µ,s ( w ) is characterized by the fully factorized Gaussian family with w i iid ∼ N ( µ i , exp(2s i ) ) . So , the standard deviation exp(s ) will be a natural measure of weight uncertainty . Moreover , unlike the dropout where the drop rate is determined by user , this uncertainty is learned from data starting from the prior knowledge N ( 0 , s 2 0 I ) . The density plot is shown in Fig . 4 . We can see that the posterior has two modes , one with smaller variance and the other indicates larger variance . This phenomenon has significant implications : it shows that some weights are either not estimated precisely , or these weights are not important to the final prediction loss . For both reasons , we can prune the weights which have large deviation or represent them with just a few bits .

We hypothesized that these profile changes are due to binding of LuxR and displacement of H - NS . To ensure peak height differences were not due to differences in sample preparation ( i.e. library preparation / number of sequencing reads ) , we identified 98 loci that contain H - NS peaks but are devoid of any LuxR peaks . We reasoned that these peaks would not be directly influenced by LuxR and thus we could normalize the H - NS sequencing read distribution to these peaks ( normalization procedure detailed in methods ) . Following normalization , we re - compared these 98 peaks and found that the loci remained significantly correlated between wild - type and luxR backgrounds ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . With the read counts normalized , we then analyzed the H - NS peak heights at select LuxRbound loci that showed strong ChIP - seq peak signals for both proteins . Each of the loci which are directly activated by LuxR / repressed H - NS showed an increase in H - NS peak height in the absence of LuxR ( Figure 3A , C , D - F ) , indicating increased binding of H - NS at these loci . Interestingly , when we analyzed the difference in H - NS peak heights between the wild - type and luxR backgrounds , we noticed a single LuxR binding site often influenced both H - NS peaks , even if separated by 2 kb as is the case with VIBHAR 02472 ( Figure 3E ) . Even at two loci that LuxR does not regulate under our tested conditions , there is a measurable H - NS peak height difference when LuxR is bound compared to the luxR background ( Figure 3 G , H ) .",330,253313701_92,

The data showed a~40 % increase in the area of GAA - treated myotubes compared with that of DM myotubes ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , the total MyHC protein level and MyHC isoform mRNA levels were also determined ( Figure 4C and Figure S3A - C ) . Because cathepsin L ( CTSL ) and atrogin-1 ( FBXO32 ) are marker genes of skeletal muscle atrophy [ 39,40 ] , their expression was also determined , but no significant difference in this regard was identified between the GAA and control groups ( Figure 4G , H ) . To further define the effect of miRNAs on muscle growth , the mice were treated with GAA dissolved in drinking water . We detected creatinine content in serum ( Figure S1B ) and determined that 1 % and 2 % GAA could be added in subsequent experiments . As a result , we observed that the GAA supplement reduced the expression of miR133a-3p and miR-1a-3p in mouse gastrocnemius tissue ( Figure 4D ) .

We hypothesized that reduction of miR-372 may decrease repression to its mRNA targets , thus enhanced the phosphorylation of CREB in liver cancer . So , we did a search for miR-372 target mRNAs through online software : Tagetscan ( www .targetscan.org ) , MicroInspector and RNA22 ( cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/rna22_targets.html ) revealed a common target site in 3 0 UTR of Prkacb ( cAMPdependent protein kinase catalytic subunit beta ) mRNA ( Figure 8A , left panel ) , the protein product of which can translocate into nucleus and thus activate CREB ( 14,29 ) . The Prkacb 3 0 UTR was then cloned into psiCHECK vector ( pSi - Prkacb ) . Luciferase assays indicated that Prkacb mRNA is genuinely targeted by miR-372 ( Figure   8A , right panel ) according to the procedure described in Figure 7C. However , Prkacb mRNA obtained no significant change after over - expression of miR-372 or miR-372 inhibitor for 1 day revealed miR-372 without affecting Prkacb at the transcriptional level ( data not shown ) .

Futhermore , the protein expression level is higher in Hep3B than that in HL-7702 cells ( Figure 8C ) .

Furthermore , assaults and robberies may be less likely to be officially recorded in countries with limited judicial or police structures .

Hamartin expression was significantly reduced ( p<0.01 ) in CA3 neurons 14 d following unilateral administration of the shRNA vector targeting TSC1 ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . The magnitude of suppression was less than that achieved in vitro , perhaps as a result of there being both transduced and untransduced cells in the microdissected tissue . Fourteen days after administration of TSC1 shRNA and control shRNA into the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus , respectively , we subjected rats to ischemia or sham ischemia ( Fig . 3a ) . Because global ischemia produces a uniform bilateral insult , we used the contralateral side as control . Following ischemia , the ipsilateral TSC1 shRNA - treated side had 105.9±4.0 neurons per mm in the CA3 region compared to 139.2±3.2 neurons per mm on the contralateral control shRNA - treated side ( p<0.01 ; Fig .   3b , c ) . Activation of compensatory mechanisms in some CA3 cells with suppressed Tsc1 expression , as well as a non - linear relationship between shRNA knockdown efficiency and loss of CA3 neuronal resistance , could explain the modest effect of TSC1 shRNA . Tsc1 knockdown did not alter neuronal cell number in the CA3 region of sham operated rats ( Fig .   3b , c ) .

Despite widespread warnings regarding dangers of poor online security practices , a surprisingly high percentage of users remain still very naive about security on OSN ( Jang - Jaccard and Nepal , 2014 ; Sundar and Marathe , 2010 ) . Since incentives for OSN use differ , privacy concerns , trustiness and individuals ' behavior towards them also vary . A lot of individuals take into account OSN risks and adhere to necessary security settings , while other individuals are clueless and exposed directly to underlying risks . According to "" privacy paradox "" , individuals with high level of privacy concerns are more vulnerable to personal data disclosure , while there is inconsistency between privacy concerns and privacy settings ( Acquisti , 2010;Acquisti and Gross , 2006;Norberg et al . , 2007 ) . Of particular interest are the findings of Hoadley et al . ( 2010 ) who ascertained that easy information access and "" illusory "" loss of control on Facebook prompted by the introduction of News Feed features trigger privacy concerns to its users . Actually , individuals ' privacy perceptions and concerns are affected by various socio - demographic , psychological and cultural factors . Acquisti and Gross ( 2006 ) and Cecere et al . ( 2015 ) found that males are less concerned than females regarding online privacy , Jensen et al . ( 2005 ) claimed that women are more hesitant than men , while other empirical studies revealed that there is no significant difference between two genders ( Sheehan , 2002;Yao et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , Yao et al . ( 2007 ) revealed that beliefs in privacy rights , as well as psychological needs for privacy are the main influences on online privacy concerns . With regard to age and education , relative studies have concluded that both of them have positive impact on individuals ' privacy concerns ( Bellman et al . , 2004;Brown and Zukowski , 2007;Cecere et al . , 2015;O'Neil , 2001;Sheehan , 2002 ) . Finally , Cecere et al . ( 2015 ) the level of individuals ' privacy concerns is determined by both cultural and socio - demographic factors . Specifically , analyzing data from a survey drawn up for EU , they found that Northern and Eastern European countries are less concerned about the misuse of personal data than Central and Southern European countries , while at the individual level , the results demonstrate that women , highly educated and middle - aged individuals are more concerned about potential personal information misuse than other individuals ' groups .",458,205214379_29,

The only notable spectroscopic difference ( compared to MTO reaction ) was the absence of a 387 nm band in the case of methyl acetate as an effluent , which belongs to the hexamethylbenzenium ion . Thus , methyl acetate was able to generate the hydrocarbon pool species upon exposure to H - SAPO-34 at 673K. Next , the MS data of this reaction , as presented in Figure S8d , reveals the presence of methane , methanol , dimethyl ether ( DME ) , lower olefins ( ethylene , propylene and traces of butylene ) and dimethoxymethane ( DMM ) . Therefore , the detection of methanol / DME from methyl acetate implies the transformation between methanol and methyl acetate is actually reversible ( path c in Scheme 1 ) over zeolite at 673K. Interestingly , a substantial quantity of DMM was observed from methyl acetate ( Figure S8d ) , whereas only traces of DMM were detected during the MTO reaction ( Figure S2d ) .

648a39b81b9b67847889689a,71146552,Nature Human Behaviour,6,"Using a resolution that is rather more fine - grained than the existing literature ( 1 Hz temporally and 0.1867 cycles / octave spectrally ) , we first examined behavioral responses in English speaking participants ( N=20 ) . Listeners were presented the materials diotically and reported intelligibility and speaker voice pitch ( male or female ) . This approach has been employed infrequently in the literature 38,48 , and here we report psychometric curves on voice pitch identification as well as intelligibility in the critical modulation range for speech ( i.e. 2 - 8 Hz ) . Filtering out temporal modulations completely abolished intelligibility at the lowest cutoff ( 2 Hz ) and showed a logistic relationship between the amount of temporal modulation present in the signal and the degree of intelligibility . The most prominent boost in intelligibility was observed when stimuli contained more than 5 Hz temporal modulations and , unsurprisingly , during the second block of the task , when all stimuli were repeated ( within - subject non - parametric factorial permutation test main effect of block P F - value = 88.84 , p<0.001 , 95 % CI of null hypothesis statistic=[0.029 , 2.68 ] , Figure 4a , Supplementary Figure 2 ) . This effect is especially striking as each sentence is only presented once within a block , so the performance boost represents information from only one additional exemplar . As proportion data as well as categorical outcomes can violate ANOVA assumptions 49 we chose to use a non - parametric approach 50 and subsequently model psychometric curves within each participant using a logistic function 51 . The mean and standard error distribution of curve fits across participants are plotted as a continuous shaded line in Figure 4 . To quantify the temporal modulation ranges where the psychometric curves showed a significant difference between the first and second block a paired Wilcoxon signed - rank test was performed for each value and a continuous block of 2.8 and 7.1 Hz was found significant ( non - parametric Wilcoxon signed - rank test p<0.05 ) . Spectral modulations abolished the ability to correctly identify the speaker 's voice pitch with a sharp increase in the performance when stimuli contained above 0.74 cycles / octave spectral modulations ( Figure . 4a right panel ) . There was no effect of block ( within - subject non - parametric factorial permutation test main effect of block P F - value = 0.1195 , p=0.992 , 95 % CI of null hypothesis statistic=[0.0795 , 2.96 ] ) nor was there a significant difference between psychometric curves ( non - parametric Wilcoxon signed - rank test p>0.17 for all paired tests ) . These results provide a compelling link between the two axes of the modulation space and our ability to process the content of speech and speaker identity ( speaker identity was maximally different in our stimulus at 1 cyc / oct , see Supplementary Figure 3 ) . We next asked whether differences in cortical processing across the two hemispheres could be detected using psychophysical measures . We designed a dichotic paradigm that leverages an asymmetry in the auditory pathway when different stimuli are presented to each ear 52 . While the classic dichotic design elicits a right ear advantage when short ( usually consonantvowel ) competing stimuli are presented , we presented identical sentences that varied by the amount of temporal or spectral information in each ear ( e.g. 3 Hz in the one ear and 4 Hz in the other , etc . ) . In a separate cohort of participants ( N=60 , see Methods , Psychophysical Experiments ) , we found a significant behavioral advantage when the right ear was presented with more temporal modulations than the left ( main effect of ear within - subject nonparametric factorial permutation test P F - value = 18.963744 , p<0.001 , 95 % CI of null hypothesis statistic=[0.05455 , 2.689 ] , Figure 4b left panel ) . This right ear advantage ( REA ) reveals a specific hemispheric preference for processing high temporal modulations and no preference for low temporal modulations and the psychometric curves showed significant differences for values between 3.6 and 6 Hz ( non - parametric Wilcoxon tailed signed - rank test p<0.05 for all paired tests ) . An analysis of the raw data in the voice pitch identification task did not exhibit a significant LEA during the task ( main effect of ear within - subject nonparametric factorial permutation test P F - value = 2.497 , p=0.079 , 95 % CI of null hypothesis statistic=[0.03147 , 2.916 ] , Figure . 4b right panel ) .

When applying these findings , an obvious question arises regarding the typical exposure duration and distance data . To address this issue , Zhang et al . ( 2020b ) monitored and analyzed indoor human behavior in a graduate student office using automatic devices . They measured a median duration of close proximity of 15 s and an average interpersonal distance of 0.81 m during such close proximities . Adopting such median exposure durations , the corresponding infection risk is negligible ( i.e. less than 0.1 % , adopted as the threshold value by Buonanno et al . ( 2020a ) ) , reaching 0.5 % for exposure times of 1 min . Only with long exposure times ( 15 min ) the risk would become significantly higher than 1 % . Therefore , even though Zhang et al . ( 2020b ) verified that 9.7 % of employees ' time in offices was in close proximity ( with 4.0 close contacts h −1 ) , an interpersonal distance of 0.81 cm is sufficient to have a limited risk for the measured exposure times ( < 1 min ) in the analyzed common occupational scenario . Apart from workplace scenarios , the interpersonal distance is an essential feature of individuals ' social behavior more broadly in relation to their physical environment and social interactions ( Hall , 1966 ) . On the basis of the classical proxemic theory ( Hall , 1966 ) , interpersonal distances are classified as ( i ) public distance ( > 2 m ) , ( ii ) social distance , during more formal interactions , ( iii ) personal distance , during interactions with friends , and ( iv ) intimate distance , maintained in close relationships , with Southern European , Latin American , and Arabian countries being the so - called "" contact cultures "" , and North America , Northern Europe , and Asian populations being the "" noncontact cultures "" ( Hall , 1966 ) .

When the DM annihilates via higgs messengers to τ + τ − , the neutrinos are softer than in the previous case . However , since the electrons ( positrons ) are also softer , explaining the ATIC data requires that the DM mass in this framework is quite heavy ( ≈ 4 TeV for the annihilation mode ) with a large boost factor B e tot ( ≈ 10000 ) . This effect tends to compensate the effect of soft neutrinos mentioned above [ 16 ] and one expects to get approximately the same neutrino flux as for the direct annihilation case 6 . This naively implies that the neutrino - induced muon flux for the annihilation mode ( 16 ) with an NFW profile of the GC is also above the bound set by Super - K. However , as for gamma - rays , one has to keep in mind that B ν tot = B e tot in general . The clumpiness boost factor B ν clump is similar to that for photons because neutrinos , like photons , hardly lose energy and come from far away . Therefore , B ν clump is strongly direction - dependent in general . To get more precise constraints from neutrinos coming from the direction of the GC , one has to know the ratio of B ν clump ( in the direction of the GC ) 7 and B e tot .

648a446f1b9b678478bb7763,5044615,Science of The Total Environment,41,"The improved model reproduced the observation of N 2 O emissions measured in the experiment with various agricultural management treatments ( Fig . 7 ) reasonably well , as indicated by the correlation coefficients in Table 8 . The trend in the fit of our simulations with measured data was similar to those using process - based models containing a similar algorithm for estimating nitrification and denitrification to the one we have implemented and reported here ( e.g. Fitton et al . , 2014;Ludwig et al . , 2011 ) . However , some peaks were observed in the data which were missing in the simulation results . Three potential reasons might cause this : input errors , experimental error and modelling uncertainties . Uncertain inputs of soil physical and chemical properties might contribute to the errors in estimating N 2 O emission ( Nol et al . , 2010 ) . Soil properties and the sizes of state variables ( pools ) in a profile are essential for a simulation . Some soil parameters , e.g. saturated hydraulic   conductivity and macro - pore volume , had to be estimated because measurements were unavailable . The estimated soil properties could be different from those of the experimental sites , which would inevitably have led to inaccurate estimates of N 2 O emission . Furthermore in some circumstances , measurements of driving variables for the processes and the emissions , such as water content and the concentrations of mineral N forms , were made close to , but not at the exact same location as the N 2 O flux measurements . Errors in simulating soil water redistribution in the soil ( Fig . 5 ) are especially important . For this reason there may be discrepancies between the driving variables and the observed fluxes that the model could not be expected to identify . Thus the model represents average field conditions within the experiment but measurements incorporate spatial heterogeneity . Observations from discrete sampling points may not always represent the true mean values . The pools need initial values for a simulation run . However , the pools related to soil C and N cycles are arbitrarily determined in the model , which could result in inappropriate initial values ( Wu and Shepherd , 2011 ) . In many field studies , N 2 O emissions have demonstrated that the emissions were heterogeneous in space and time ( Ambus and Christensen , 1994;Bouwman , 1996;Mathieu et al . , 2006;Rees et al . , 2013;Yanai et al . , 2003 ) and , as a consequence , the pattern of N 2 O flux can be difficult to predict without a good knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability in underlying control variables . Quantifying the denitrification process is still associated with considerable levels of uncertainty , which makes its simulation more challenging ( Barnard and Leadley , 2005;Firestone et al . , 1980;Jetten , 2008 ) . Denitrification would be particularly sensitive to any errors in simulating soil water distribution ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , although there are some important environmental factors that affect the process , e.g. soil acidity , soil water content in the soil profile and soil temperature , there may be some other factors or processes , e.g. changing soil acidity after fertiliser application , and adequate representation of soil microbial processes that are not adequately represented in the model . A simulation model is always a simplification of the reality , but a successful model would be capable of capturing the general dynamics and overall effect of observed data . Inevitably , therefore there are discrepancies in the detailed description of simulated result and measurements .",628,7074899_8,

648a398e1b9b678478887957,237094380,Advanced Materials,10,"The small ratio between the forward and backward transfers predicted by theory and measured experimentally reflects the small energetic driving force . Together with the DFT calculations , the kinetic fit to the experimental TA data confirms subpicosecond electron transfer dynamics as well as the establishment of an S 1 -CT equilibrium that is shifted toward the CT state ( higher forward than back - transfer rate ) , rather than incomplete quenching of the initial exciton population . The significant electron back - transfer to the S 1 state observed here also explains the relatively high photoluminescence that was reported earlier for this blend system . [ 14 ] Another key finding is that the average CT dissociation rate ( CT → F ) is about 65 ps , which is orders of magnitude slower than the ultrafast ( ≈100 fs ) free charge generation reported for typical polymer : fullerene blends . [ 27,[39][40][41 ] Such slow CT state dissociation has nevertheless been observed for other systems with low driving force for charge transfer . [ 42,43 ] This suggests that an energetic S 1 -CT offset is necessary for excitons to directly couple into delocalized states of fullerene clusters and enable prompt separation of electron - hole pairs . For low offset blends such as P(DPP6DOT2 - T):PC [ 70]BM , other mechanisms involving high local charge mobility and disorder become more important ( see below ) . A consequence of the relatively slow CT state dissociation is the competition with CT state recombination , which is aggravated by two factors in the investigated DPP system : First , the CT → S 0 relaxation time ( ≈17 ps ) is unusually fast judging from the kinetic model fit of our TA data . Considering only the CT - S 0 energy gap , MLJ theory predicts a much slower recombination time on the order of a few tens of nanoseconds . The fast CT state decay is possibly related to its hybridization with the short - lived S 1 state , which results in a much higher oscillator strength for the CT → S 0 transition . Second , the CT → S 1 back - transfer offers an additional recombination channel via fast relaxation of the S 1 to the ground state . Overall , we observe significant loss of the exciton plus charge population on the 1 ns timescale , so that the yield of free charges is only 12 % .",418,146803893_43,
648a42a11b9b678478ad59d1,236947320,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,15,"To confirm that JA is involved in fertility regulation , the sterile and fertile PGMS and PTGMS plants were treated by spraying with MEJA or SHAM to achieve fertility reversal . For the PGMS rice lines D52S and NK58S , spray application was effective in changing the pollen fertility as expected , and but it had no effect on PA64S ( data not shown ) . The PGMS line was treated to obtain the presumed sterile / fertile plants , according to the basic photoperiod approach mentioned above . After spraying MEJA , 19.01 % and 64.07 % pollen grain fertility was detected in the anthers of young NK58S and D52S panicles , respectively ( Table 2 and Figure S8 ) . On the other hand , fewer fertile pollen grains ( less than 10 % pollen fertility ) were detected in the anthers after spraying SHAM ( Table 2 ) . Under certain photoperiod conditions for the prospective sterile line , partial pollen fertility could be induced in NK58S and D52S by the MEJA treatment , leading to fertility reversal .

These results indicated that JA did participate in the regulation of rice anther development and pollen fertility . Pollen fertility in the PGMS rice line was significantly upregulated by MEJA spraying , leading to partial fertility ( NK58F - F - R and D52S - F - R ) and the reversal of the expected natural sterile conditions .

As we show below , we chose to measure the diameter of N103B in four directions ( see Figure 1 ) , effectively forming two orthogonal cardinal coordinate systems . Before making these measurements , we made one final filtering of the data . The ACIS array has suffered significant degradation at low energies due to contaminant buildup since launch . At low energies , the difference between the effective area in 1999 and 2017 is quite significant . Thus , we only considered counts at energies above 1.7 keV ( up to 7 keV ) , high enough to ensure a nearly similar effective area to the 1999 observations while still capturing the strong ∼ 1.8 keV Si Kα line .",164,235172107_28,

They clearly show that the DNA construct diffuses into the bleached spot from the sides , and that the bleached spot is fully restored with time .

We focused on the case in which the total widths of the resonances are much smaller than the mass splitting . We have shown that , in general , the ∆σ M -induced fractional error in the measured mass splitting , M s , and in the leptonic partial widths of the resonances ( or leptonic partial widths times final state branching fraction ) depend only on M s /σ M and on the ratio of the two partial widths , a. The main result is that the errors are generally big for M s /σ M less than a certain critical value ( typically in the 2 ÷ 3 range ) that is a function of a. As M s /σ M increases beyond the critical value , the ∆σ M -induced fractional error in the mass splitting approaches zero rapidly , whereas the fractional errors in the partial widths approach ∆σ M /σ M . As a concrete case , we have discussed the application to the two spin-1 resonances of the Degenerate BESS model for beam energy spread of the same order as the mass splitting between them . We determined the regions of the model parameter space in which M s could be measured with ∆σ M -induced fractional error below a given fixed value assuming a given value of R. The smaller the value of R that can be used while maintaining sufficient luminosity for small statistical errors , the larger the fraction of allowed parameter space for which M s can be measured with small ∆σ M -induced error . In particular , R < 0.1 % is required if we are to be able to separate the degenerate resonance peaks for model parameter choices not already excluded by precision experimental data in which the resonance masses are as low as 100 GeV.

648a444b1b9b678478bad393,52137567,Light-Science & Applications,18,"To shed more light on the details of the plasmon excitations of these nanosponges , extensive simulations of the time - dependent local electromagnetic fields at the nanosponge surface were carried out . Simulations were performed using the FDTD method 43 , using the freely available software package Meep 44 . We used a model geometry that is very similar to the experiments but did not attempt to reproduce the exact realization of the porosity for either sample . The procedure for creating the model geometry on the computer was as follows . Prolate metal semi - ellipsoids were placed on a dielectric substrate with a refractive index matching that of ITO . Small , slightly overlapping spheres were generated inside the ellipsoid . Starting from the exterior , the gold was removed from these spheres if they had contact to the surface , in analogy to the etching process during the sample preparation . Therefore , isolated inclusion spheres remain metallic and a percolating porous network is created inside the metallic nanoparticle , see Figure 1c . The filling factor of the pores in the nanosponge can be adjusted . Filling factors of~36 % for the pores reproduce the experimental dipolar plasmonic resonance well , as is evident in Figure 2 . A higher filling factor shifts the resonances toward the infrared , consistent with Maxwell - Garnett effective - medium theory . To model the optical properties of gold , we use an analytical Drude - model fit to experimental data 45,46 . The Drude relaxation times in the model of~10 fs ( Refs . 42,46 ) are considerably shorter than the observed SPP decay times because a large fraction of the SPP energy is stored in vacuum . A plane - wave source with a wave - vector perpendicular to the substrate was used for the 3D geometry to calculate the scattering properties and field dynamics . The excitation was a Gaussian pulse with the same 16 - fs pulse duration as in the experiments and polarized along the semi - minor axis . The extinction spectra from the FDTD calculations are presented as the dark dashed lines in Figure 2 . They reproduce the fundamental plasmonic dipole mode frequency well for the given filling fraction , but the Fano - type resonances are barely visible in the extinction spectra . They can , however , be observed in absorption spectra , depicted by the light Long - lived electron emission reveals localized plasmon modes G Hergert et al dashed lines in Figure 2 , which are increased 10 - fold in the plot because the absorption is comparatively weak . In the calculated spectra , there are no visible peaks in the long wavelength part of the spectra , whereas in the experimental results , the dips in the spectrum appear to be spread out over the entire frequency range in the plot . Figure 5a shows details of the spatial dynamics of the long - lived modes that cause the features in the scattering and autocorrelation spectra . To obtain this plot , the decaying fields after the excitation period were evaluated at the center of each individual pore and then spectrally analyzed using harmonic inversion 47,48 . A model for nanosponge A yields several independent modes with different frequencies . All modes are concentrated near the surface and are highly localized to a few pores ( Figure 5b ) , with the most prominent ones - not only for sample A , but for most nanosponges - being situated roughly along the ellipse vertices , where the semi - minor axis meets the surface of the ellipsoid . The intensity of the dipolar excitation is maximal in this region , indicating that the localized modes are excited indirectly via the dipole plasmonic mode that couples to the far - field . Proof for this is found in the detailed temporal dynamics . At each point on the surface , we find the presence of an intense and short - lived plasmon field that vanishes within the first 20 fs . The time dynamics of the field intensity follows the intensity profile of the laser pulse , which shows that the lifetime of this delocalized plasmon mode is shorter than the pulse duration of the laser ( 16 fs ) . In addition , we find , at selected positions , that there is a coherent and delayed excitation of localized modes with a phase difference of ≈π/2 between them . The field dynamics matches that of the multi - exponential decay model used for the fit of the experimental data in Figure 4 . Clearly , the localized modes are long - lived , as seen in Figure 5b and 5c . The former shows the field intensity that remains at a time delay of 120 fs in a cross section through the nanosponge , that is , long after the initial dipolar excitation of the nanosponge has died out . The latter shows the temporal evolution of the field intensity on a circle along the surface of the nanosponge ( see the dashed line in Figure 3b ) . In both plots , we see that a few tens of femtoseconds after the excitation , the whole remaining intensity is localized in the same modes that are already visible in Figure 5a . The initial dipolar excitation is delocalized and short - lived , as seen in Figure 5c .",917,248267379_218,

The relationship between the ENA temperature ( calculation method of Yue et al . 2016 shown in the Appendix ) and solar wind kinetic energy on the dawnside and duskside is shown in Figure A5 . When calculating the temperature in Figure A5 , we excluded several events that might be without a magnetic shielding effect and outside of the lunar mini - magnetosphere or deflected solar wind particles affected by the neighboring magnetic anomalies ( Xie et al . 2021 ) . These deflected particles increase the penetration rate to a certain extent that might have an effect on temperature .

The blue line shows the linear fitting results on the duskside , and the red line shows the results on the dawnside . The differences between the dawnside and duskside data points in Figures 5 and A5 are statistically significant . This is verified by the t - test applied to the dawn and dusk data sets . The two - sample t - test is a parametric test that can be used to assess whether two samples have the same distribution ; a p - value of the t - test of less than 0.05 means that there is a significant statistical difference between the two data sets .

This confirms that the dawnside and duskside data sets belong to two different distributions .

These observations are executed with the ACA , in Bands 3 , 6 , and 7 . Since fullpolarization mode is adopted , it is possible to retrieve polarimetry information from the GS sources . This is done with AMAPOLA 17 , a set of CASA - friendly Python scripts used to reduce the full - Stokes polarimetry of GS observations with ACA . Some of our targets are part of the GS , including : 3C273 ( J1229 + 0203 ) ; 3C279 ( J1256 - 0547 ) ; 4C 01.28 ( J1058 + 0133 ) ; 4C 09.57 ( J1751 + 0939 ) ; J0510 + 1800 ; OJ287 ( J0854 + 2006 ) ; J0006 - 0623 ; J1733 - 1304 ; and J1924 - 2914 . Although the reported values by AMAPOLA are used for observation planning and the two arrays cover different uv - ranges , it is still useful to make a comparison with this database to assess any systematics or clear inconsistent variability within a week 's time - frame . Figures 15 and 16 show the observed polarimetry parameters for the 2017 VLBI sessions ( data points and errorbars ) , specifically Q , U , and V Stokes parameters , LP , and EVPA . The shaded ±1σ regions highlight the time variance of the same parameters as measured by AMAPOLA ( an inflection in the trend means a time of GS observation ) . The colour - coding is such that blue refers to Band 3 measurements , green to Band 6 , and red to Band 7 ones . These figures show that most Band 3 ALMA - VLBI measurements fall within the blue regions , while most Band 6 measurements fall inbetween the blue and red regions , indicating that our measurements are broadly consistent with the AMAP - OLA trends . Some potential conflicts can still be consistent with the inter - GS - cadence variability or differential time - variability between frequency bands ( as also observed in some cases in the AMAPOLA monitoring ) .

In particular , for type IIA compactifications it appears in the kinetic terms for the scalars ξ I , ξ I coming from the expansion of the RR potentials ( see eqs . ( 3.50 ) and ( 3.62 ) below ) . Namely , it is one of the special geometry data that determine , via the c - map , the quaternionic metric for the N = 2 hypermultiplets σ - model . While this is familiar for dimensional reductions on a Calabi - Yau , we have shown that the same structure can be extended to more general settings , for instance to cases in which the basis forms are not of pure degree . It is readily checked that when considering Calabi - Yau ( or more generally SU(3 ) structure [ 7 ] ) compactifications , ( 3.33 ) reduces to the well known expression for the action of the Hodge * on the harmonic 3 - forms . Indeed in this case , because of the constraint B∧α I = B∧β I = 0 , the action of * B on Σ − simplifies to the action of the usual Hodge * , so that α , * B β = α∧ * β ( similarly for the other pairings ) .

First , adversarial robustness depends on the smoothness of the classifier around natural images , which can be estimated from unlabeled data .

Because for both pulsars we have established radio ephemerides we ignore trials factors and simply assign pulse phases as described above . For PSR J0740 + 6620 a simple Z 2 2 test yields a test statistic of Z 2 2 = 251.19 , corresponding to a detection significance of 15.35σ for 574405 events in the 0.31 to 1.22 keV range . We take advantage of the fact that the filtered NICER count rate ( about 0.6 - 1.0 s −1 ) is dominated by the background , with the pulsar contributing only a few percent to the total count rate . We can use the total count rate in each GTI interval as a proxy for the effective background count rate and employ the GTI sorting method described in Guillot et al . ( 2019 ) . The GTI sorting method breaks the original GTI intervals into shorter segments and adds each segment into the evaluated time series , making sure that the overall pulsation significance increases with each addition . The lowest count rate segments are included first , and we add in segments that have increasing count rates ( thus higher background ) so long as the detection significance continues to increase . Once the background noise becomes sufficiently large that adding additional GTIs from the original distribution decreases rather than increases the detection significance , we stop the procedure . When we apply this method to PSR J0740 + 6620 we increase the overall pulsation detection significance to σ = 15.46 for 521004 events in the 0.31 to 1.18 keV range . The GTI selection is particularly effective for faint pulsars with count rates ∼ 0.01 c / s such as PSR J0740 + 6620 .

To gain some insight into the physiologic mechanism by which ADAM12 gene transfer and miR-29a inhibition improved perfusion recovery in HFD mice , we hypothesized that this may be occurring through improved recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells . We therefore assessed the extent of endothelial progenitor cells recruited into the ischemic mouse GA muscle of HFD mice using flow cytometry . We quantified the percentage of infiltrating cells expressing CD45 − CD31 + CD34 + , which are known endothelial progenitor cells makers [ 33 ] . Our results show that both ADAM12 gene transfer and treatment with miR-29a inhibitor led to an increase in the percentage of CD45 − CD31 + CD34 + cells as compared to the control untreated group ( normal chow : 0.69 % ± 0.08 , HFD : 0.25 % ± 0.03 , HFD + ADAM12 : 0.55 % ± 0.08 , and HFD + miR-29aINH : 0.58 % ± 0.11 . * p < 0.05 , Figure 5A - F ) .",244,231651942_59,

For those tumors that escape oncogene addiction and recur , c - Myc elevation represents a potential resistance mechanism with respect to current PI3K - targeted therapies in clinical trials . To explore whether PIK3CA mutations and c - MYC elevation coexist in human breast cancer , we analyzed several breast cancer datasets containing both PIK3CA mutation status and c - MYC copy number or expression data [ 18][19][20][21 ] . Among these cohorts , substantial fractions of PIK3CA mutation positive tumors have increased c - MYC copy number as well as mRNA and c - MYC protein levels 2223 ( Supplementary Fig . 16 and Supplementary Table 3 ) .

As Ca6[Ge2N6 ] does not contain elements for which localized magnetic moments would be expected , the diamagnetism ( ~ -75·10 -6 emu / mol ) is attributed to Ca6[Ge2N6 ] , whereas the paramagnetic tail is just due to small amounts of unspecified impurities .

648a60bd1b9b6784787c0e6e,253479295,Nucleic Acids Research,35,"Altogether , the data also indicated that the DNA binding mechanism of a given TF may radically change with subtle changes in structural domains outside the DNA recognition region . In the case of Ardk and KorA , it is the flexibility of different regions of the dimerization domain that directs the protein towards straddling or domain rotation . Sequence alignments point to a conserved glycine in the Pro - Trp turn present in KorA and KorA - like proteins ( Supplementary Figure S7A ) . In KorA , this Gly70 and the adjacent residue Glu69 freely rotate upon DNA binding ( Supplementary Figure S7B ; Supplementary video 5 ) . In ArdK and ArdK - like proteins , this glycine is not conserved , and the equivalent residue is a glutamic acid ( Glu65 ) . Upon binding , there is no rotation of this amino acid ( Supplementary Figure S7C ; Supplementary video 6 ) . As judged from the conserved sequences found in the target promoters of members of this family ( Figure 4A ) , these subtle changes enable these TFs to recognize DRs and IRs with different spacing . Since alterations in the flexibility of unorganized regions of a protein are difficult to identify , it is possible that this structural flexibility is not exclusive to KorA / ArdK proteins , but common to other TFs . For example , changes at the dimerization interface of the glucocorticoid receptor , located outside the DNA - binding domain , determine sequence specificity ( 5 ) . These results underline the importance of looking outside the DNA - binding domain to identify the structural constraints that direct DNA binding specificity . Moreover , they caution against assuming that the binding mechanism of a given TF may be directly inferred from sequence conservation . Instead , they underscore the need for detailed biophysical analyses to unravel the mechanisms behind the specificity of DNA - binding proteins .",329,233420409_21,

However , these results conflict with the typical endocytosis mechanism that usually involves endosomes and lysosomes . This conflict may indicate that [ 2]OAc traffics to mitochondira directly after dynamin - and clathrin - mediated endocytosis , an endocytotic mechanism that is unusual but was reported recently . [ 31 ] Alternatively , the accumulation of emissive nanoparticles in the mitochondria at 24 h could also be the result from passive uptake of the compound as monomer , migration to the mitochondria driven by the negative charge of the mitochondrial membrane ( [ 2 ] + is monocationic ) , and re - assembly due to the increased local concentration of the monomer . The decrease in colocalization of [ 2]OAc with both the lysosomes and the mitochondria after 45.0 h might be due either to partial degradation of the complex , or to disassembly ; this is suggested also by   aggregates . Although the increase is statistically significant , the difference is of the same order of magnitude in the intensity scale ( a bit more than 6000 AU for 21.0 h , vs ≈ 5000 AU for 3.5 - 6.0 h ) , whereas visually it appears more intense ( Figure 5a , third row ) . This observation may be attributed to a non - linear relationship between the phosphorescence intensity observed and the size of [ 2]OAc aggregates formed .

The aryl iodide was introduced into the protein through an alkylation reaction of a cysteine residue . Full conversion ( > 95 % ) within 30 minutes was achieved at 37 ° C in a phosphate buffer ( pH 8.0 ) with a number of aryl , heteroaryl , and vinyl boronic acids .

This problem was later solved by surveying a number of potential metal scavengers for palladium removal , with 3 - mercaptopropionic acid identified as the best candidate .

Galectin-9 blockade resulted in substantial tumor regression ( Figure S7d ) . Further , akin to Dectin-1 deletion , combined blockade of Galectin-9 and PD-1 trended to offer synergistic protection against orthotopic PDA ( Figure S7e ) and resulted in enhanced T cell activation ( not shown ) .

On the other hand , if we impose conditional independence between observations and latent variables at other timesteps given the current one ( i.e. , p(x t |z ) = p(x t |z t ) ) , there will then be at best ( by the data processing inequality ( Cover & Thomas , 2006 ) ) a break - even situation between the KL cost of encoding information in z t and the resulting improvement in the reconstruction loss .

However , none of these projects directly measures violations of democratic standards in government responses to the Covid-19 pandemic . For example , the ICNL tracks legal instruments and government practices across fourteen issues related to human rights and civic freedoms ( Page and Ognenovska , 2020 ) . While this information is useful for qualitatively assessing certain types of violations or certain cases , it does not provide a way to systematically compare countries or make general assessments of international human rights compliance . Likewise , IDEA ( 2020 ) emphasizes democratic institutions and practices that we expect to see during normal times , rather than assessing whether practices during a crisis specifically violate democratic standards for emergency situations . Assessing these violations is crucial to understanding how states respond to global emergencies and whether international human rights obligations inform those decisions .",169,231678178_4,
648a441f1b9b678478ba2bbc,235570216,Advanced Energy Materials,17,"Having been derived from the fill - factor FoM θ ( Equation 4 ) , l dr /d can be employed for correlating with the FF . On the other hand , we have argued earlier that the parameter θ , and therefore l dr /d , is more related to the efficiency of charge extraction at short circuit , J SC /J G . This is indeed the case . Figure 4b shows the relationship between J SC /J G and l dr /d from the simulation of devices as in Figure 4a , with balanced mobilities but all other parameters varying over a wide range . [ 10 ] The simulations predict the onset of a significant current loss once the drift length becomes smaller than the device thickness . The very same trend is seen experimentally , with J G approximated by the saturated photocurrent at the reverse bias J sat ( − 1 V ) . From these results we learn that the drift length in most systems exceeds the junction thickness ; suggesting negligible photocurrent losses at SC conditions . However , there are systems which suffer from such current losses and these are indeed the devices ( mostly ) with a rather small l dr in relation to device thickness . As evidenced by the simulation results for different carrier mobility ratios , the spread of the experimental points may be related to the imbalanced mobilities , although the influence of such factors as the presence of shunting , field - dependent generation , formation of the space charge region etc . , should also not be excluded ( see Figure S4 ( Supporting Information ) and JV - Curves Under Illumination ) . We note here that a photocurrent loss due to inefficient extraction will always go along with a reduction of the FF and that this FF - loss will set in much earlier than the decrease of J SC . This is the exact reason why the FF deviates from the ideal case already at a θ of ≈10 −4 ( see Figure S4d Figure 4b ) . The very good agreement between the experimental data points and the prediction by the Hecht equation is striking , giving the simplicity of the experimental approach in determining l dr . The results presented herein point towards the possibility of utilizing the photoconductance measurements for the characterization of the FF and short - circuit current loss of a wide variety of photovoltaic devices , including state - of - the - art high - performance systems . Specifically , the l dif /d ratio is shown to provide a good correlation with the device FF , simultaneously allowing to distinguish between the transportlimited and Shockley - type solar cells . As indicated by Equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , improving the effective drift and diffusion lengths for a given active layer thickness relies on increasing the τμ product . Being constituted of the two components , two strategies of maximizing this product may focus on either enhancing the carrier lifetime or mobility . Eventually , according to the drift - diffusion simulations ( Figure 4 ) as well as the analytical expressions ( Equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ) , achieving the FF values above 80 % is possible when the effective diffusion length approaches and exceeds the active layer thickness , although higher V OC also plays a positive role . For example , for a 100 nm organic solar cell with V OC = 0.8 V to achieve 80 % FF , its τμ must be around 4 × 10 −9 cm 2 V −1 . Assuming the carrier recombination lifetime of around 5 - 10 µs , this would imply the effective carrier mobility of 4 × 10 −4 -8 × 10 −4 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is becoming increasingly realistic , given the latest advances in the performance of NFA - based OPVs .

The organic layer was retained and the aqueous layer extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 ( 2 × 50 mL ) . The organic extracts were combined , dried over MgSO 4 and dried in vacuo . 1 H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture revealed 28 % conversion of macrocycle 1 of the target [ 3]rotaxane 15c , based on their characteristic signals at 7.94 ppm and 6.30 ppm respectively ( vide supra ) . Column chromatography ( 0 - 30 % MeCN/ 1:1 Hexane : CH 2 Cl 2 ; +0.25 % EtOH throughout ) afforded the product as a white foam ( 5.3 mg , 28 % ) , with characteristic data consistent with that stated above .   Analysis of the reaction mixture prior to work - up ( Fig S2a ) indicated complete consumption of macrocycle 1 and the presence of a new interlocked species ( signals shown in red ) . Analysis by MS revealed a mass ion corresponding to [ 12a+Cu+H ] 2 + suggesting that Cu remained coordinated . After aqueous work - up of a portion of the reaction mixture using NH 3 -EDTA a new threaded species was observed ( signals shown in orange ) , which was assigned as metastable [ 2]pseudorotaxane 12a by analogy with previously isolated [ 2]rotaxanes , alongside some recovered 1 ( blue ) . When this mixture was heated at 80 ° C for 1 h the majority of the threaded species was destroyed , producing non - interlocked thread and macrocycle 1 . This demonstrated the instability of 12a with respect to dethreading . In contrast , when the reaction mixture heated for a further hour at 80 ° C no significant changes were observed ; the species assigned as [ Cu12a ] persists and macrocycle 1 ( or its copper complex [ Cu1 ] ) remains absent . Furthermore , even after heating the reaction mixture for 16 h at 80 ° C , aqueous work - up with NH 3 -EDTA confirmed the presence of 12a . Taken together , these results not only confirm the presence of a metastable threaded product both before an after work - up , they strongly suggest that Cu stabilises the threaded species .",494,3695872_72,

To do so , we first enumerate all possible programs under the DSL up to a specific number of instructions , which are then partitioned into training , validation and test sets . In order to have a tractable number of programs , we limited the maximum number of instructions for programs to be 13 . Length 13 programs are important for this specific DSL because all larger programs can be written as compositions of sub - programs of length at most 13 . The semantics of length 13 programs therefore constitute the "" atoms "" of this particular DSL . In testing our model , there are two different categories of generalization . The first is input / output generalization , where we are given a new set of input / output examples as well as a program with a specific tree that we have seen during training . This represents the model 's capacity to be applied on new data . The second category is program generalization , where we are given both a previously unseen program tree in addition to unseen input / output examples . Therefore the model needs to have a sufficient enough understanding of the semantics of the DSL that it can construct novel combinations of operations . For all reported results , training sets correspond to the first type of generalization since we have seen the program tree but not the input / output pairs .

MAM can also be extended to interference and digital holographic microscopies for 3D imaging with enhanced resolution . This can be simply achieved in an interferometric arrangement , by placing the MS within the working distance of either a conventional objective lens [ 10][11][12][13][14][15 ] or a dedicated interferometric objective lens ( Fig . 1b ) 16,17 . MAM has well matched up with interferometric - based approaches , such that both have benefited from each other 's features . Although interferometric arrangements have significantly higher axial resolution compared to conventional microscopy , their lateral resolution would still be restricted by the diffraction limit . However , MAM combined with interferometric setups has shown promising results in producing 3D label - free images with enhanced lateral resolution . Additionally , MAM has shown its potential to be easily integrated with other resolution - enhancing schemes , such as structured and oblique illumination , to achieve even further resolution enhancements in 3D microscopy systems 18,19 . Microsphere - assisted interference microscopy provides an inexpensive and non - destructive imaging technique for 3D surface metrology 17,20 and microsphere - assisted digital holographic microscopy ( DHM ) brings forward a costeffective and easy - to - implement high - quality quantitative phase imaging approach in transmission and reflection modes 21 . The advantages of MAM over other resolution enhancement techniques for DHM are further featured ; 22,23 in MAM , due to the symmetric structure of the MS , the resolution enhancement is achieved simultaneously in all spatial directions , which is extremely important in real - time imaging of specimens with rapid dynamics 12,24 . On the other hand , MAM benefits from DHM 's advantageous features . Adding a spherical lens to a conventional microscope introduces non - negligible spherical aberrations 1 . It also brings about a curved deformation in the measured phase in interference microscopy , which in turn further sacrifices the effective field - of - view ( FoV ) 13 . However , in DHM , thanks to the phase compensation possibility , the effect of any possible contaminations and aberrations in the optical train on the final data can be removed . To this end , phase information of the reference hologram ( taken for no - sample state in the setup ) is subtracted from the object phase during the numerical reconstruction process 25 . Another challenging issue in MAM that can be less important in microsphereassisted DHM is precise positioning of the MS and in some cases preserving the relative sample - to - microsphere distance 26 during the imaging . However , in DHM , it is consistently possible to be numerically focused on the image plane post - recording of the digital hologram to achieve the best possible imaging quality 27 . Nevertheless , similar to all kinds of MAM , microsphere - assisted interferometric - based approaches also suffer from the limited FoV , which still needs to be addressed in a sustainable manner .",532,53219212_46,

The claim is that when large numbers of random gauge copies are used in fixing the gauge ( in an effort to minimize the Gribov copy problem ) , the center - projected string tension underestimates the full string tension by as much as 30 % . Our purpose in the present article is to show that , while BKPV have certainly raised an important issue , their actual data was strongly affected by the rather small lattice volumes used in the numerical simulations .

The input variable of the model is a chemical composition , which is characterized by a descriptor vector of length 232 . As detailed later , the compositional descriptor expresses the content of elements , which is conventionally operated with a predefined set of element features , such as electronegativity and atomic weight . [ 28,29 ] The output variable is a class label corresponding to one of three structural categories : stable quasicrystal ( QC ) , approximant crystal ( AC ) , and "" others , "" which includes ordinary periodic crystals . ACs are periodic crystals composed of the similar local structural unit , such as an icosahedral cluster , as the corresponding QCs . Importantly , ACs are formed in nearby compositions of QCs , which means that their stabilization mechanisms are very similar to each other . Hence , for clarification of their common sta - bilization mechanism , it will be of great advantage to separate ACs from all the other periodic crystals that are termed "" others "" here . A list of the chemical compositions of known stable quasicrystals , approximants , and ordinary crystals was used as the training data . We systematically evaluated the potential predictability of the proposed machine - learning model for the threeclass classification problem . Furthermore , virtual screening of all ternary alloy systems containing aluminum and transition elements was conducted for the entire search space . The phase prediction results were compared with 30 experimental phase diagrams extracted from the literature , and the predictability was investigated in detail . The overall accuracy of the phase prediction task reached approximately 0.728 .

The amalgamation of sustainability and innovation - two fundamental aspects of contemporary economic thinking and global governancetowards the different discourses on ' innovation for sustainable development ' progressed against a background of dual separate developments . In the late 1980s , two parallel processes that would get to exert strong influence on policy and practice worldwide were initiated : The Brundtland report ' Our Common Future ' on sustainable development ; and the far less known two Nordic workshops ( the first on the basis of a paper from the Nordic Science Council in 1988 ; the second in Oslo in 1989 ) that resulted in the first Oslo manual on measuring innovation activities . While the Brundtland report defined the new , hegemonic way of thinking about development and growth through the discourse of sustainable development ( Brown , 2016 ) , the Oslo manual can also be argued to have provided a hegemonic way of thinking about innovation ( see Fougère & Harding , 2012 ) through collecting and interpreting innovation data from companies in different OECD countries .",206,232244943_65,
648a398e1b9b678478885815,6318390,Advanced Materials,9,"The observed oxygen - rich ring can be reproduced by modeling a thermally - driven diffusion of oxygen . A number of forces may act on the oxygen vacancies , for example : electric field - driven vertical drift followed by concentration - gradient - driven lateral diffusion ( Fick diffusion ) , [ 13 ] substitutional diffusion [ 8 ] and/or thermophoresis . [ 12,14 ] To show that a simple combination of two such lateral forces can account for the rings , we use one such example of thermophoresis in a local lateral temperature gradient , such as is expected around a conducting channel , balanced by Fick diffusion . Electric field - driven oxygen migration is usually significant in initiating and sustaining the switching mechanism , [ 8,29,30 ] which has been addressed using fully coupled threedimensional solutions , [ 12 ] and is ignored here in light of highlighting a high - power - driven amplified irreversible change to the material , which is essentially a failure mechanism . Our measurements have shown that asgrown films contained numerous incipient oxygen defects , including interstitials and vacancies ( Figure S2 ) . Upon application of voltage pulses , as the first percolating current pathway is created there will be a localized temperature profile due to joule heating . [ 14,[31][32][33 ] In this model , the resultant lateral temperature gradients produce thermophoretic forces ( Soret effect ) that attract oxygen vacancies radially inward to the hot conducting channel ( against the motion of oxygen interstitials ) , while Fick diffusion , driven by the resulting gradient of oxygen concentration , balances thermophoretic forces . [ 8,14,34 ] We represent this process by a combined continuity equation / = . + . , where nV is the vacancy concentration , JFick and JSoret are fluxes due to Fick diffusion and thermophoresis , respectively . Using this approach , we predict the resultant x - ray intensity profile and compare it to experimental data ( Figures 3c-3d ) , which shows good agreement with each other . Details of the calculation are provided in the Supporting Information based on published analysis of thermophoresis in oxide memristors . [ 14,35,36 ] Further experimental support for the thermally - driven nature of the oxygen interstitial rings emerges when we consider that the ring deviates from circular symmetry only at the bottom electrode edge , observed consistently in several devices ( highlighted in Figure 3b ) . Similar features observed in Ref . [ 37 ] were attributed to abrupt change in thermal conductance at the bottom electrode edge ( see Supporting Information ) , and suggest that higher temperatures are localized close to the bottom interface ( Pt ) where resistance switching likely occurs . This observation also asserts the importance of electric - fielddriven vertical forces during formation of conducting channel , although in our case , due to irreversible changes and accelerated failure of the device , the continued role of electric - field during application of every voltage pulse diminishes and is hence ignored .",517,245112757_64,

Therefore , less focus should be placed on only estimating and presenting this conventional ICER . Rather , it is better to present results in a manner that aligns with relevant constraints . For instance , in the context of human resource constraints it is important that results of economic evaluations need to be presented so that decision makers can see how much human resources costs are required to gain QALYs . In specific cases , depending on the availability of data , it is possible to adjust conventional ICERs . Key for our proposed adjustments of conventional ICERS is that constraints are expressed in monetary costs rather than units of health care inputs such as number of doctors or nurses . As such , our proposed approach is less flexible than a more general mathematical programming approach . But , it is easier to understand and is a more natural extension of cost effectiveness results . However , even in the absence of suitable data for ICER adjustments , the issue of how health care input constraints might affect optimal decisions needs to be discussed properly in applied cost effectiveness analysis . Crucial is that opportunity costs and thresholds are constraint specific and that opportunity costs are higher ( and thresholds lower ) for the constrained health care input . Furthermore , a scarcity of estimates of threshold levels of cost effectiveness should not be an excuse to ignore health care input constraints when making policy recommendations . Rather , we advise to make use of rules of thumb . For instance , new technologies that are cost - effective compared to currently funded programs but require lots of skilled labour should not automatically be funded . Vice versa , new technologies that are not cost - effective compared to currently funded programs but require less skilled labour can be attractive . Before applying such rules of thumb , one must start by identifying health care input constraints by focusing on a criterion like the presence of skilled labour .

To address uncertainties in hazmat transportation , three main alternative techniques have been applied : fuzzy logic ( Ghatee et al . , 2009;Du et al . , 2017;Ke et al . , 2020 ) , stochastic programming ( Opasanon and Miller - Hooks , 2006;Gülpinar et al . , 2013;Ardjmand et al . , 2016;Rabbani et al . , 2019 ) , and robust optimization . Although fuzzy approaches can be used to describe vague and imprecise information , especially linguistic variables , stochastic and robust models are considered superior in the sense that they follow a mechanism to adapt to uncertainties . Stochastic programming is applicable when the input parameters are probabilistic but following a known probability distribution with known estimators . The major issue with stochastic programming is the difficulty of obtaining the probability distribution functions of the underlying stochastic parameters , which has become a huge disadvantage for those who plan to utilize this approach . In the case of robust optimization , the approach is to obtain an optimal solution that is robust and feasible for a set of uncertain data . In the following , we review the studies in the hazmat transportation literature that explicitly deal with uncertainty by applying robust optimization . Xin et al . ( 2013 ) proposed a hazmat transportation network design problem with uncertain edge risk . A robust heuristic approach through a simple heuristic was developed and tested on a network in China . They proved that the robust interval risk scenario network performs better than the deterministic scenario network . Kwon et al . ( 2013 ) studied a robust shortest path problem where the cost is computed by multiplying two uncertain factors . A path enumeration approach based on a K - shortest path finding algorithm was applied to hazmat transportation for illustration purposes . A robust facility location problem for hazmat transportation considering routing decisions of hazmat carriers was investigated by Berglund and Kwon ( 2014 ) . In an elaborated discussion , they reiterated that the stochastic model is less effective for hazmat location and routing problems and acknowledged that the robust approach is more appropriate . Risk uncertainty on network links was also considered by Sun et al . ( 2015 ) . Under the assumption that the availability of links is influenced by the ban on a few of them by government regulations for hazmat transportation , they considered the worst - case risk - measures with an uncertain budget for flexible decision making . Chiou ( 2017 ) integrated the signal - setting policy to hazmat network design through a min - max bi - level robust programming model . Risk - averse signal settings were determined under budget - of - uncertainty demand when taking into consideration the travel delay caused by regular traffic . Ma et al . ( 2018 ) developed a multi - objective robust optimization model on the basis of the Bertsimas - Sim robust optimization theory . They used a fuzzy C - means clustering particle swarm optimization algorithm to cluster the demand points , and then an adaptive archives grid to compute the robust route of transportation . More recently , robust optimization has also been applied to gauging the disruptions in a hazmat transportation network . Ke ( 2020 ) applied a scenario - based robust optimization approach to efficiently managing random disruptions existing in rail - truck intermodal hazmat transportation systems .",603,13680958_14,

Publicly available RNA - seq data reveal that GPR68 expression is 10.5 - fold higher in 147 PDAC tumors ( TCGA ) than in 165 normal pancreas samples ( GTEx database ) . GPR68 expression increases early in tumor development and is highly prevalent in both male and female PDAC patients [ 7 ] . As indicated in Figure 5 , GPR68 expression is low in pancreatic cancer cell lines and thus its high expression in PDAC tumors ( Figure 4 ) likely reflects expression by cells in the TME other than the cancer cells themselves . The three other members of the proton - sensing GPCR family ( GPR4 , GPR65 , and GPR132 ) are not detected in pancreatic CAFs [ 24 ] . PSCs co - cultured with PDAC cells or incubated with TNFα have induction of GPR68 expression . GPR68 activation ( by decreasing extracellular pH ) enhances IL-6 expression via a cAMP / PKA / CREB signaling pathway . Knockdown of GPR68 by short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) diminished low pH - induced IL-6 production and enhancement of PDAC cell proliferation by pancreatic CAF conditioned media . PDAC cells thus induce expression by pancreatic CAFs of GPR68 , which senses the acidic microenvironment , thereby increasing production of fibrotic markers and IL-6 and promoting PDAC cell proliferation . Our studies have shown that knockdown of GPR68 expression in CAFs leads to reduced cell viability compared to control cells at acidic condition ( pH ≤ 6.6 ) , suggesting that GPR68 provides a survival mechanism for CAFs in acidic conditions [ 24 ] . Transfection of GPR68 in PSCs increased expression of fibrotic markers while siRNA knockdown of GPR68 in pancreatic CAFs decreased expression of fibrotic markers ; pancreatic CAFs treated with low pH had slightly decreased expression of the pro - fibrotic marker alpha smooth muscle actin ( αSMA ) and collagen [ 24 ] . By contrast , a previous study showed that extracellular acidity promotes transformation of mesenchymal stem cells to CAFs through a GPR68 - YAP ( yes - associated protein ) signaling pathway [ 70 ] .

In this paper , ship price involves the acquisition price of new ships and that of second - hand ships . In the actual market , there is a difference between the two prices , arising from the reselling of ship assets . For convenience , this difference is neglected in this research . It is assumed that the same amount of payment is needed to purchase ships from the two ways , which equals the actual ship price . The only difference between the two ways is that the buyer can choose between more ships of more types by purchasing new ships than purchasing second - hand ships . Moreover , there exists a price difference in the cost of buying and selling ships . After querying the price data on the ship market , the cost difference between the acquisition and sale of existing ships was defined as a fixed value , and applied to different ship types with the same capacity . A4 : This assumption is about ship retrofit . It is assumed that the fuelswitching ships in the initial fleet have diverse retrofit options . These ships can be modified into other sulfur reduction technologies . However , if a ship already chooses to install a scrubber or LNG dualfuel engines , it would be deemed as unfit for retrofit .

Therefore , it is assumed that , with changes in market conditions , the cost ratio of LNG to HFO could reach 80 % , 70 % , and 60 % , corresponding to the low , medium , and high fuel market scenarios , respectively . In other words , the higher the fuel price , the greater the cost advantage of LNG . In general , ships prefer to choose LNG as the fuel for LNG dual - fuel engines . In addition , pure LNG was not treated as a technology for emission reduction , because LNG supports fewer types of ships than dual - fuel engine , and the types of pure LNG - powered ships are severely limited by the LNG bunkering stations on the route .",421,238686546_29,

While the capacity for each step of absorption should theoretically be 0.5 molar equivalents each , a better fit of the experimental data was obtained at 0.35 molar equivalent . The difference between the theoretical and the experimental values is related to the partial MnCl 2 inaccessibility as a significant portion of the absorbent is likely to be either trapped in blocked pores of the silica gel or within a large MnCl 2 particle . The order for ammonia pressure relative to equilibrium in the absorption steps was fit as 4 because it generated a significant drop in rate at higher temperatures ( i.e. , higher equilibrium pressure ) that was apparent in the data even though equilibrium had not been reached . A higher order dependence on ammonia pressure relative to equilibrium was also reported previously . [ 32 ] The high order ( 4 and 6 ) with respect to accumulation in the absorption steps was a result of large inhomogeneities in particle size and morphology , which causes different particles to reach absorption saturation or experience a significant drop in rate at different times . When representing the ammonia removed over time by the model ( Figure 2d ) , the high order was reflected in the sharpness of the decrease in rate as the absorbent fills over time ( i.e. , the higher order , the sharper drop ) . It is important to note that this model is likely not applicable at high temperatures ( > 400 ° C ) because the absorbent might degrade or very high ammonia pressures because the mechanism may change .",301,8903723_21,

[ 44 ] Assuming head - to - head and tail - to - tail orientation of the domain polarization , these simulations revealed that polarized domains in MAPbI 3 thinfilms can effectively influence charge carriers , form separate electron - and hole - pathways and hence create charged domain walls as illustrated in Figure 5 . This configuration reduces the Shockley - Read - Hall recombination losses within grains and improves the fill factor as well as the overall power conversion efficiency of the corresponding solar cells . The experimental current density - voltage ( J - V ) curves were best reproduced with a polarization strength of 0.2 µC cm −2 . While the experimental data described above allows for both charged and uncharged domain wall configurations , simulations can not reproduce the J - V curves assuming uncharged domain walls ( head - to - tail domain polarization ) . Uncharged domain walls would hardly influence the charge carrier recombination but in effect rather compare to a zero - polarization ( non - ferroelectric ) scenario . Although uncharged domain walls may exist in MAPbI 3 grains in a polycrystalline thin - film , better device performance will be achieved if their formation is suppressed . Importantly , vertical ( out - of - plane ) components of the polarization do not show any notable influence on charge carrier density or recombination rates since , in steady - state , these polarization components are compensated by charge carrier accumulation at the interfaces to anode and cathode , respectively . However , if nonohmic contacts are assumed , the surface dipoles of vertically polarized domains may assist or hinder charge carrier extraction to the electrodes . [ 10,45 ] As described above , grains that exhibit such vertical polarization components were only observed occasionally in our experiments while the vast majority of grains showed inplane polarization . In this light , the control of in - plane polarization deems to be important for future device and process designs . Yet , it remains to be investigated how to best control the polarization orientation in MAPbI 3 domains . Following up on recent discussions about ion migration in domains , we further speculate that , in dark conditions , charged domain walls are populated by ionic charge carriers ( I − , CH 3 NH 3 + ) that are gradually replaced by electrons and holes upon illumination . This process might contribute to changes in photocurrent during dynamic illumination . [ 46 ]",461,52944753_21,

These primary astrocytes were cultured in vitro for 355 days ( primary culture established on 12 March 2018 and first passage on 2 March 2019 ) when we noticed that the media of two wells from different animals became yellow . We dissociated the two cells and cultured them individually . By the time we submitted the manuscript , both cell lines had been passaged for more than 200 times . We genotyped these cells and confirmed that one line is originated from a Tsc1 flox / fox WT mouse ( designated as Ast # 1 ) and the other is from a Tsc1 GFAP cKO mouse ( designated as Ast # 2 ) . We did not observe an obvious difference in morphology between Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 ( as shown in Figure 1A ) , but we noticed that Ast # 1 cells spread faster than # 2 cells after plating . Western blot data indicated a diminished TSC1 expression in Ast # 2 compared to Ast # 1 cells ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with the genotype data . Using primary astrocytes as control , we also found decreased TSC1 expression in Tsc1 GFAP cKO astrocyte compared to WT astrocytes ( Figure 1B ) . Consistent with the decreased TSC1 level , the TSC2 level also decreased in Ast # 2 cells as TSC1 functions through stabilizing TSC2 ( Figure 1C ) . As expected , mTORC1 activity significantly increased in Ast # 2 cells as indicated by the elevated levels of pS6RP ( phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein ) and p70 S6 kinase ( pS6 K , phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein kinase ) when they were compared to Ast # 1 cells ( Figure 1C ) . We treated both Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells with Rapamycin at 100 nM , which abolished the pS6RP and pS6 K levels in these cells , suggesting the inhibition of mTORC1 activity ( Figure 1C ) . TSC1 and TSC2 levels were not affected by Rapamycin treatment ( Figure 1C ) . These results indicated that loss of TSC1 would cause mTORC1 hyperactivation in immortalized astrocyte . the elevated levels of pS6RP ( phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein ) and p70 S6 kinase ( pS6 K , phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein kinase ) when they were compared to Ast # 1 cells ( Figure 1C ) . We treated both Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells with Rapamycin at 100 nM , which abolished the pS6RP and pS6 K levels in these cells , suggesting the inhibition of mTORC1 activity ( Figure 1C ) . TSC1 and TSC2 levels were not affected by Rapamycin treatment ( Figure 1C ) . These results indicated that loss of TSC1 would cause mTORC1 hyperactivation in immortalized astrocyte . Next , we analyzed the neural stem / progenitor cell ( NSC ) markers and astrocyte markers expressed in Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 around the passages of 75 . The protein level of astrocytic maker GFAP ( glial fibrillary acidic protein ) and GS ( glutamine synthetase ) significantly decreased in both Ast # 1 and # 2 compared with primary WT astrocytes ( Figure 1D ) . In contrast , there was a marked increase of Sox2 ( SRY - Box Transcription Factor 2 ) protein level in Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 compared to primary astrocytes . There was also a modest increase of nestin level in the immortalized cell lines ( Figure 1D ) . Immunofluorescent staining showed nuclei localization of Sox2 and cytoplasmic localization of intermediate filament nestin in both Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cell lines ( Figure 1E ) . We used qRT - PCR to check the NSC markers in Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells as well as in neurospheres from WT and Tsc1 GFAP cKO mice . Consistent with the immunofluorescent staining , we found comparable levels of nestin mRNA and Sox2 mRNA expression in both Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells ( Figure 1F ) . We noticed more than 3 - folds decreased expression of nestin mRNA and Sox2 mRNA in immortalized cell lines compared to those in neurospheres ( Figure 1F ) . Next , we cultured the Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells under suspension conditions and we found that both cell lines formed spheres with similar size ( Figure 1 G ) . Serial dilution of seeding cells for spheres indicated that there was no difference in the sphere formation ability for both Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells ( Figure 1 G ) . With the gain of some NSC / progenitor characters , we noticed a dramatic decrease of astrocyte markers of GFAP and Aqp4 ( Aquaporin 4 ) in Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells . Their mRNA levels were only 1 - 2 % ( GFAP ) or less than 1 % ( Aqp4 ) of those in primary astrocytes ( Figure 1H ) . The mRNA level of another astrocyte marker , Cx43 , was also significantly lower in Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells compared to primary astrocytes ( Figure 1H ) . mRNA level of Cx43 , but not GFAP and Aqp4 , in Ast # 2 cells was significantly higher than that in Ast # 1 cells ( Figure 1H ) . Taken together , these data suggested that the Ast # 1 and Ast # 2 cells obtained some NSC / progenitor status during the process of gaining immortalization .",970,3174407_31,
648a441f1b9b678478ba1b69,231942588,Advanced Energy Materials,26,"While taking the derivative defined by Equation 3 is a simple task for smooth , simulated data , it is quite challenging to extract meaningful derivatives from noisy experimental data . Therefore , it is advisable to not or not only take the derivative of the background corrected raw data but to first fit the data with a function and then differentiate the fit . We note that given the multitude of non - exponential features affecting the transients , we opted to identify functions for which the fit algorithm converges easily and leads to a good agreement with the experimental transients even though the functional form of the fit functions bears no physical meaning . We observed that good candidates for fit functions are high order polynomials that can be fitted to the logarithm of the PL . Alternatives are rational functions , i.e. ratios of higher order polynomials . In Figure 13c and d , we therefore see symbols and lines , where the symbols represent the derivative of the background - corrected and stitched raw data while the lines are the derivative of the fits to the data . Both agree within the accuracy of the method , which isat least partly a consequence of the raw data being fairly high quality ( low noise level ) due to long integration and high measurement times . The EF axis for the experimental data was determined from the knowledge of the laser fluences used in the measurement ( provides the initial EF at time zero after the pulse with Equation 4 ) and the knowledge that the PL intensity scales with exp(EF / kBT ) . [ 47 ] This proportionality implies that any order of magnitude decrease in PL leads to a 58 mV decrease in EF . From comparing the glass / MAPI / TOPO ( grey ) samples of the coevaporated and the solution - processed perovskite sample series in Figure 13c and d , it is directly apparent that the quality of the bulk differs substantially . In addition , the coevaporated cell suffers from increased interface recombination relative to the solutionprocessed cell , which we conclude from the substantial reduction in TPL , HLI  for the samples with interfaces ( green and red ) relative to the passivated layer on glass ( grey ) . Furthermore , the comparison in Figure 13 demonstrates that the representation of the decay time TPL , HLI  via Fermi - level - splitting EF is advantageous compared to the usual representation of the decay itself . This new type of graph highlights differences and similarities between the samples more clearly and allows estimating recombination parameters .    Figure S21 , we show how the simulations with lower SRH lifetimes look like . From Figure S21 , we conclude for lifetimes τn + τp < 40 µs , the agreement between simulation and experiment deteriorates substantially . SRH bulk lifetimes as high as 80 µs would allow an open - circuit voltage of 1.31 V under AM1.5 g illumination , i.e. a value very close to the radiative limit of 1.32 V. [ 13 ] The solution - processed samples with PTAA ( green , yellow ) do not suffer from additional losses . The decay times are similar to the passivated sample with the glass / perovskite interface . The band offset between perovskite and PTAA and the surface recombination velocity must therefore be negligibly small . In the Supporting Figure S21 we demonstrate that a surface recombination velocity must be around SPTAA=1 cm / s. Also , the band offset and surface recombination at the PCBM / perovskite interface must be quite small to explain the data . Nevertheless , the PCBM / perovskite interface is the only interface that causes visible deviations of the PL transients from the behaviour expected in the radiative limit . We find that a surface recombination velocity SPCBM=17 cm / s and an offset of 70 meV lead to the best agreement with the experimental data .",681,15654042_12,

648a60bc1b9b678478790636,15455855,Nucleic Acids Research,13,"As an initial test of the function of UAS - MycTra2 transgene insertions , we crossed each strain to various driver strains expressing yeast GAL4 with different tissue distributions ( Table 1 ) . However , adult flies carrying the combination of GAL4 and UAS - MycTra2 transgenes were not recovered in these crosses due to lethality at earlier developmental stages . To overcome this , we generated flies in which Tra2 expression was driven by the heat - inducible heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) promoter which is active at a low level in a wide variety of somatic tissues even when flies are cultured at 23 C without heat shock . This low level of GAL4 activity allowed us to recover from 41 to 70 % of the expected individuals carrying both hsp70 - Gal4 and UAS - MycTra2 as viable adults ( Table 1 ) . The number of survivors was diminished to < 1 % when flies were subjected to heat shock at various times during larval development .    Western - blot analysis of total protein from adults raised without heat shock confirmed that they express a protein product of the expected size for the MycTra2 fusion protein ( Figure 3B ) . A small amount of another product detected specifically in transgenic flies migrated at a smaller size . This may be either a product of proteolysis or due to translation initiation from one of several AUG initiation codons within the Myc tag repeats near the protein 's N - terminus . In either case , the levels of functional MycTra2 expression were sufficient to partially rescue sexual differentiation defects in the soma of diplo - X ( chromosomally female ) individuals homozygous for a tra2 loss - of - function mutation as indicated by feminization of their genitalia , leg bristles and abdominal pigmentation ( data not shown ) . Thus , the MycTra2 protein is functional in the soma . Even when expressed from the hsp70 - GAL4 driver at 23 C UAS - MycTra2 caused some reduction in viability relative to Mendelian expectations ( Table 1 ) . Such lethality might result either from an excess of protein in tissues where it is normally expressed or from an aberrant activity conferred by the Myc tag . In the former case we would expect that viability would be improved if Tra2 expression from the endogenous gene was reduced in transgenic flies . Consistent with this we observed that transgenic individuals homozygous for a tra2 loss - of - function mutation were significantly more viable ( P < 0.0001 ) than their tra2 + siblings ( Figure 3C ) . We conclude that excess Tra2 is deleterious to survival .",460,238530423_7,

This sample was obtained after omitting those interviewed in the mainstage questionnaire ( pre - pandemic waves ) but during or after March 2020 ( when the first national lockdown was imposed in the UK ) . In this way , all the interviews of the mainstage questionnaire were conducted before COVID-19 . We then retained only those who always answered questions related to mental health ( our outcome of interest ) and informal care .

The possibility to scan the performance for different LED emission spectra and light intensities , ensures a fair comparison between PV publications as the arbitrariness of low light setups is inevitable . While our method is applicable to any solar cell technology , where J sc can be precisely determined from the external quantum efficiency , we apply our method to organic solar cells whose data are either measured in house or taken from literature . First , we validated our evaluation method thoroughly and showed that about 65 % of the efficiencies studied from literature are in good agreement with our model . The other 35 % showed total deviations of the absolute efficiency > 3 % , including some absolute efficiencies deviating ≈8 % . These deviations stress the need for consistency checks of low light efficiencies using quantum efficiency data and LED spectra to support the current voltage curves . Furthermore , we demonstrated quantitively the delicate dependence of the output power and the efficiency of iOPVs on the LED spectra . The efficiencies are governed by the overlap of the quantum efficiency and the LED spectrum and vary by ± 20 - 25 % when using different LED spectra depending on the absorber band gap . Calculations with an ideal absorber within the Shockley - Queisser limit with a fixed illumination of 200 lux completed this study and emphasized that there is still substantial room for improvement of this technology as the maximum Shockley - Queisser efficiency is 52 - 54 % depending on the used LED spectrum . The optimal band gap of the absorber depends on the LEDs ' spectrum and is ranging between 1.75 and 2 eV. Finally , we analyzed a wide set of different iOPVs from literature and rank them according to their efficiency under the LED that fits each cell best . This fair comparison shows that the presented calculation is a powerful tool to detect possible candidates for high indoor performance solar cells for an arbitrary light source .

In the studied urban area , combustion of fossil fuels from motorized vehicles is the major source for PAH ( Alier et al . , 2013;Mortamais et al . , 2017 ) . Highest ∑PAH concentrations were measured at the platform of Joanic ( 4.2 ng / m 3 ) and Sagrera ( 4.1 ng / m 3 ) , while the lowest were measured at the platforms of Collblanc ( 0.5 - 0.6 ng / m 3 ) . The relative composition of individual PAH was dominated by benzo[b + j + k ] fluoranthene ( BFL ) followed by benzo[ghi]perylene ( BGP ) , although in the samples collected at the platforms of Sagrera , Palau Reial and Poble Sec higher abundances of chrysene were observed . Benzo[a ] pyrene ( BaP ) , the only PAH that is regulated by law ( EC , 2004 ) with an annual target value for outdoor PM of 1 ng / m 3 and a recommended annual value of b0.12 ng / m 3 ( WHO , 2013 ) , showed highest mean concentrations at the platform of Joanic ( 0.66 ng / m 3 ) and Sagrera ( 0.31 ng / m 3 ) . The lowest concentrations , 0.04 - 0.08 ng / m 3 , were measured at the Collblanc platforms . The other stations showed intermediate BaP between 0.12 and 0.25 ng / m 3 . These levels are generally lower than the target value of outdoor PM and in the range of the recommended value for health safety for outdoor exposure . The observed BaP concentrations are very similar to those measured by local authorities in the outdoor PM in urban traffic sites in the city ( Fig . 4 ) and comparable to those observed in indoor air in primary schools ( Mortanais et al . , 2015 ) . Generally , the outdoor ambient air BaP concentrations are higher in the colder period ( October to March ) and are predominantly related to fossil fueled engine vehicles ( Alier et al . , 2013;Reche et al . , 2012 ) . The sampling days and sites of outdoor BaP do not   coincides with those in the present study , but there is a good correlation between outdoor vs. indoor station platform BaP levels ( Fig . 4 ; R 2 = 0.81 ; p b 0.001 ) . Stations that were sampled in the colder period , i.e. Joanic and Sagrera , show highest outdoor and indoor platform BaP levels . In this study , the seasonal trend can be best observed in the sampling sequence at the platform of Sagrera station ( n = 35 ) from half January until the end of March 2015 . A substantial decrease of the BaP concentrations can be observed ( Fig . 5 ) . This compound correlates ( R 2 = 0.86 ; p b 0.001 ) well with levoglucosan concentrations in the same samples ( Fig . 4 ) . In the complete data set ( including all samples from all stations ) this correlation is also significant ( R 2 = 0.55 ; p b 0.01 ) . The strong correlation of these compounds at the subway platforms does not automatically means that BaP is linked to biomass burning , but it indicates that the outdoor air PM is a major pathway for BaP , and other PAH , to the indoor air at the platforms . The modern stations , constructed in 2016 , show substantially lower concentrations of organic pollutants due to the more sophisticated ventilation systems and the summer sampling period .",625,207947078_6,

So far , studies on KIBs employing potassium metal anodes , solid electrolytes and cathodes such as Prussian blue with remarkable capacities and cycling stabilities were reported . [ 32][33][34][35 ] Surprisingly , only a few solid potassium ion electrolytes are known ( Figure 1 , for data and references see Table S8 ) . These materials are oxides and show conductivities in a reasonable range for applications ( 10 À4 -10 À2 S cm À1 ) only at high temperatures of 300 - 400 8C. The only exception is polycrystalline K 2 Fe 4 O 7 with a conductivity of 5 10 À2 S cm À1 at room temperature . However , single crystal impedance spectroscopy shows that the potassium ion migration in this compound is predominantly two - dimensional . [ 34 ] In this work , we address the family of potassium phosphidosilicates as possible solid electrolytes . Currently only the compounds K 2 SiP 2 [ 36 ] and the layered T3 KSi 2 P 3 [ 37 ] are known in this system . Both are not promising as ion conductors because of the lack of partial occupied potassium sites . Here we report three new polymorphs of KSi 2 P 3 with T5 supertetrahedral structures related to the sodium ion conductor NaSi 2 P 3 . [ 31 ] The polymorphs are characterized by X - ray powder diffraction based on the single - crystal data of the high temperature polymorph . Electrochemical impedance and MAS - NMR spectra of the new monoclinic modification revealed a remarkably high s bulk ( K + ) up to 2.6 10 À4 S cm À1 at 25 8C , and a low activation energy of 0.20 eV. This material hence qualifies as the first non - oxide fast solid potassium ion conductor . KSi 2 P 3 with the space group C2 / c was first described by Feng et al . [ 37 ] and is denominated as KSi 2 P 3 -mC96 in the following . It contains SiP 4 tetrahedra which form T3 supertetrahedra according to the Yaghi nomenclature . [ 38 ] These T3 entities are fused by one common SiP 4 tetrahedron resulting in a layered structure with the K + ions located on two fully occupied general Wyckoff sites between T3 supertetrahedral layers ( see inset of Figure 2 ) .

The averaged values were then plotted according to the expected fidelity of the annotated termination codon ( UAA > UAG > UGA ) , while comparing between stop codons followed by C at the +4 position ( more   Figure 1B ) and the calculated tendency of C - terminal extensions to form intrinsically disordered regions .

As control , we used random protein sequences of the same length distribution . As seen in Figure 5C , we found a statistically significant correla - tion between the fidelity of the annotated termination sequence ( four bases ) and the predicted disorder propensity of the downstream 3 -encoded protein sequence . On average , polypeptides derived from 3 -UTR sequences downstream of more leaky C at the +4 position are predicted to be more disordered , compared to sequences downstream of the less leaky A at the +4 position of the same termination codon ( for alternative representation of the data see Supplementary Figure S10 ) . In contrast , no significant correlation was found between the length of the same 3encoded polypeptides and the fidelity of the annotated upstream termination signal ( Supplementary Figure S11A ) . Similarly , we found no statistically significant differences between random polypeptide sequences of the same length distribution ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) . Moreover , the averaged median disorder propensities of random polypeptide sequences ( 0.41 , red horizontal line in Figure 5C ) , was lower than the median value of the most leaky termination sequences ( UAGC and UGAC , 0.47 and 0.46 , respectively ) and higher than the median value of the most efficient termination sequence ( UAAA , 0.32 ) . A similar correlation between the identities of termination sequences and averaged disorder propensities was found in 10 - 24 amino acids long 3 -UTR - encoded polypeptides , and in genomes of other organisms ( Supplementary Figures S11B and S12 ) . Hence , our calculations suggest that on average , 3 -UTR - encoded polypeptides following leaky termination sequences have a higher propensity to form intrinsically disordered regions , compared to polypeptides downstream of more efficient termination sequences .",546,252782572_27,

We note that , in order not to miss the contributions lost via thermal diffusion in time , we took the ∆T i found inside the regions with temperature greater than the critical one ( i.e. , T = 68 • C ) at the laser switching - off time , namely after 10 ps from the pumping and diffusion kick - off . The obtained values of the effective switching energy , yielded from the FEM simulations of all the 5 antenna sizes under both longitudinal and transverse polarization , are summarized in Table SII . The energy conversion efficiency η IMT is obtained by dividing the effective IMT energy E IMT by the total energy of the simulated system ( i.e. , by letting run the i subscript of formula 3 over all the elements of the simulation domain ) and is displayed in Table SII for all the concerned cases . Figure S9 graphically presents the data for the total energy absorbed by the antenna - VO 2 hybrid , the energy contributing to the IMT in the VO 2 hot - spots , and the overall conversion efficiency . Our calculations show a maximum conversion efficiency inside the VO 2 hot - spots up to 46 %   of the total absorption at resonance , i.e. , for the shortest antennas when their longitudinal plasmon mode is excited by the pump laser . However this efficiency drops steeply as the antenna resonance is shifted away from the pump wavelength by increasing the antenna length . For pumping at the transverse polarization , the overall efficiency stays relatively constant within the range 12.5%-15 % over the entire antenna length range .",336,52804764_276,

We found that these QDs have a truncated pyramid shape with a height of 3.0 ± 0.5 nm and a base length of 8.5 ± 0.6 nm . Most of the QDs are close to near pyramids with a small top facet indicating that the apex of the pyramids might have been dissolved during the capping . Detailed composition analysis was performed by using APT . FE simulations were carried out by using structural data from X - STM , and reasonably good fits were obtained for the local lattice constant profile of the cleaved QDs . FE simulations together with X - STM results are used to estimate the composition of the QDs , which is close to ∼In x Ga 1 − x As 1 − y Sb y , where x = 0.25 - 0.30 and y = 0.10 - 0.15 . A ratio of 2:1 - In : Sb was observed from atom probe experiments , which is in good agreement with X - STM , FE simulations , optical , electrical , and also the theoretical studies 27,32,40,67 . These results prove that the InGaSb and GaAs layers have strongly intermixed during the dot formation process . Finally , we reported a detailed analysis of the capping layer and observed maximum ∼3 % of Sb and In segregated from the QD layer into the capping layer . With the present study , we are able to confirm the previous results on optical , electrical , and theoretical studies , suggesting a limited Sb incorporation into QDs supporting the surfactant behavior of Sb during the dot formation process . Overall , the current study provides a detailed structural and compositional overview of these novel QDs , shedding light on the Sb incorporation into the QD layer and provides valuable feedback to the MOVPE growth of Sb - based QDs , to optimize the storage time of QD - Flash memory devices or the QDs optical activity 67 .",367,236376006_8,

648a398e1b9b678478886ca5,236774690,Advanced Materials,69,"We found that the most significant parameters in a multiple linear regression for a on the high - MW E dataset ( a total of 106 host - emitter systems ) were MW E , MW H , x E /x H , and z E , that is , the same as for the full dataset of binary systems , albeit with different regression coefficients (   We note here that we neither found L nor P to be good descriptors for the variation in a in this subset of our data , nor in any of the other subsets related to host - guest systems . x E /x H is strongly correlated to L. However , the former seems to be a better descriptor because it includes the interplay between the relative size of host and emitter molecules . In a similar way , the influence of z E on a agrees with the commonly accepted view that more planar emitters tend to align more horizontally in the film ( Figure 4a ) . However , the parameter that we believe defines planarity best ( P = 1 − ( y / z ) ) did not have any statistically significant correlation with a in any of our datasets . It is possible that z E is a good descriptor due to its simultaneous correlation to MW E and anticorrelation to both P and L. In any case , its influence on a became more apparent for the subset of high - MW emitters ( Figure 18 ) .   We repeated this analysis using data from systems with MW E > 600 Da for which the T g of the host is available ( a total of 97 systems ) . We tested the significance of this parameter in the regression and compared it to that of MW H in this subset of data . The inclusion of either T g , H or MW H led to the following two possible sets of significant parameters { MW E , T g , H , x E , z E } and { MW E , MW H , x E /x H , z E } . These are the same sets that we found when we used the full set of binary hostguest systems ( see above ) . However , in this case we found that using T g , H led to a noticeably lower 2 R than using MW H : β = 0.308 for the latter . Thus , MW H was a better descriptor than T g , H for this subset of our data . As mentioned previously , during the process of film formation , molecules that land on the substrate or on the bulk of the film can undergo significant surface diffusion , even if the bulk of the film is below its T g . [ 28,165 ] The T g of the film can still be a good reference point for the rate of this process . However , in host - guest systems this process depends on the properties of both the host and the emitter molecules , as well as on the doping ratio . [ 81,[107][108][109 ] Low - MW emitters doped at low concentrations in host matrices are less likely to have an impact on this process , as was observed by Mayr et al . for coumarin 6 doped at 2 wt% into different host matrices . [ 36 ] Nonetheless , heavy guest molecules can significantly slow down the surface diffusion , especially if they are used at high concentrations . In this case , the T g of the film can be very different to the T g of the host . [ 81 ] Therefore , the T g of the film might be a better predictor for the orientation of the emitters than the T g of the host alone , as was shown by Jiang et al . [ 107 ] This may be the reason why MW H and MW E were better predictors in our multiple regression analysis than the T g of the host . Unfortunately , the T g of the host - guest system is rarely reported in studies focusing on the orientation of emitters and this conjecture therefore requires future experimental verification . Nonetheless , our analysis shows that MW E is a key - frequently overlooked - parameter for achieving horizontal orientation of emitters , and that it is important to consider the interplay between the properties of the emitter and those of the host in emitter TDM orientation studies .",786,5265785_5,

To see this , consider first Everettian quantum mechanics ( EQM ) , according to which the fundamental ontology of the physical world is exhausted by the quantum state |ψ ; 28 different non - interacting branches of this quantum state ( as picked out by the process of dynamical decoherence ) represent different ( quasi-)classical worlds . ( For the canonical contemporary elaboration and defence of EQM , see Wallace 2012 . ) Since quantum mechanics is a theory of striking empirical success , and since EQM purports to take quantum mechanics ' at face value ' and interpret it realistically , an advocate of this approach may argue that we have good indirect evidence for the existence of such a quantum mechanical multiverse . This one might understand as an empiricist argument : this belief in the Everett interpretation 24 Cf . Carroll ( 2019 ) . 25 At least if one is more concerned by what Lewis calls ' quantitative parsimony ' ( i.e. , the sheer number of elements in one 's ontology ) than ' qualitative parsimony ' ( i.e. , the number of kinds of elements in one 's ontology ) . See Lewis ( 1986 ) for further discussion . 26 At least for the ' bundle of solutions ' multiverses considered up to this point . 27 Indeed , one could even say that one must presuppose certain rationalist motivations ( in the sense of the following section ) if one is to take there to be a landscape problem to begin with - as , clearly , Smolin ( 2013a ) does . Our thanks to an anonymous referee for this point . 28 Crucially , Everettians such as Wallace maintain that , in addition to the fundamental ontology of the physical world ( given by |ψ ) , there exists also an emergent or derivative ontology , given by a certain functionalist strategy - see Wallace ( 2012 , ch . 2)-or grounding strategy ( Wilson 2020 ) . is , ultimately , grounded in the empirical data , combined with a fairly straightforward scientific realist methodology . 29,30 One might reject the Everettian picture , based upon prior philosophical convictions . Consider , for example , the pilot wave theory , according to which , in addition to the quantum state , there exist at the fundamental level point particles ( ' corpuscles ' ) , with determinate positions at all times . If one imposes ab initio the requirement that one 's physics manifest certain aspects - for example in this case , that it have a primitive ontology of point particles - then it is clear that these requirements will be satisfied by the pilot wave theory , but not by EQM . 31 In this paper , we dub such super - empirical requirements - i.e. requirements not motivated solely by the empirical data - rationalist motivations .",526,231979207_5,

648a2ca61b9b67847842cc95,237706348,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,97,"For analyzing data , two distinctive procedures were carried out using the SPSS ® Statistics 23 software . First , we performed a MANOVA ( Multivariate Analysis of Variance ) using Wilks ' lambda test to identify differences in levels of each characteristic related to universities ( ownership and size ) , departments ( teaching and students ' financial condition ) , and lecturers / professors ( generation , experience , and subject type ) when considering the degree of the most adopted ICTs and OM teaching practices . That allowed us to comprehend the effect of contextual characteristics on the adoption level of ICTs and OM teaching practices during COVID-19 outbreak in emerging economies ( RQ 2 ) . It is worth mentioning that we examined upfront whether countries ' differences affected the adoption level of ICTs and teaching practices . Results for this specific MANOVA were not statistically significant indicating that there was no effect of country on responses and , hence , all responses could be treated as representative of the emerging economy context . Fourteen MANOVA models were then tested , each considering a specific characteristic as independent variable . As dependent variables , we only considered the adoption level of the teaching practices and ICTs clustered within the ' highly adopted teaching practices ' and ' highly adopted ICTs ' , respectively . We checked the assumptions of normality , linearity and homoscedasticity for all variables ( Hair et al . , 2014 ) . Residuals were examined to confirm normality of the error term distribution . We verified linearity based on plots of partial regression for each variable . Homoscedasticity was assessed by plotting standardized residuals against predicted value and visual examination . These tests confirmed the assumptions for multivariate data analysis . Box 's test for equality of covariance matrices for all MANOVA tests resulted not significant , satisfying the MANOVA model 's assumption ( Hair et al . , 2014 ) . Whenever a MANOVA model displayed a significant F - value we ran individual ANOVA tests to better examine differences in the dependent variables . It is worth mentioning that there is a disagreement in the literature on whether the utilization of Likert scale items in parametric statistical procedures that require interval data ( Carifio and Perla , 2008 ) . In fact , there are two streams of thoughts that discuss such issue . One stream maintains that as ordered categories , the intervals between the scale values are not equal . Any mean , correlation , or other numerical operation applied to them is invalid . Only non - parametric statistics should be used on Likert scale data ( Kuzon et al . , 1996;Jakobsson , 2004;Jamieson , 2004 ) . The other stream argues that , while technically the Likert scale item is ordered , using it in parametric tests is valid in some   G.L. Tortorella et al . Technological Forecasting & Social Change 171 ( 2021 ) 120996 situations . For example , Lubke and Muthen ( 2004 ) found that it is possible to find true parameter values in factor analysis with Likert scale data , if assumptions about skewness , number of categories , etc . , were met . Likewise , Glass et al . ( 1972 ) found that F tests in ANOVA could return accurate p - values on Likert items under certain conditions . Pell ( 2005 ) and Norman ( 2010 ) argue that ANOVA is robust against the violation of continuous scale assumption and , since the choice of non - parametric methods results in a loss of power , ANOVA is preferable . Additionally , in the absence of a definitive consensus , Carifio and Perla ( 2007 ) and Grace - Martin ( 2008 ) recommended a few guidelines if a Likert data is analyzed through a parametric procedure ; they are : ( i ) each item must have at least 5 points , ( ii ) the underlying concept of the item is continuous , ( iii ) there is some indication that the intervals between points are approximately equal , and ( iv ) ensure the other assumptions ( i.e. normality , linearity and homoscedasticity ) are met . Because our analysis met all those guidelines and the use of individual Likert - type responses as dependent variables for the MANOVA is commonly observed in the literature ( e.g. Friedman et al . , 1994;Marodin et al . , 2016;Correia et al . , 2016;Tortorella et al . , 2020c ) , we followed this parametric approach . The second procedure aimed at verifying the relationship between the most adopted OM teaching practices and ICTs during COVID-19 outbreak ( RQ 3 ) . For that , a partial correlation analysis was conducted between pairs of the highly adopted teaching practices and highly adopted ICTs . Partial correlation analysis clarifies the nature of the pairwise interaction between two variables , since it controls the effect of the remaining investigated variables ( Baba et al . , 2004 ) . Partial correlation analysis is suitable to situations where a pairwise relationship might be influenced by their relationships with other variables ( Legendre and Legendre , 2012 ) . This method has been applied in studies with similar purposes ( e.g. 2020d ) . It is important to highlight that we controlled the partial correlation analysis for the effect of the contextual characteristics whose MANOVA models were significant . To verify the existence of multicollinearity on the estimated correlation coefficients the variance inflation factors ( VIF ) was determined for all variables , which ranged from 1.08 to 3.59 . As all VIF values were below five ( Belsley et al . , 2005 ) , multicollinearity between variables was disregarded .",977,231880553_41,

We explored this seven - dimensional parameter space using edmcmc ( Vanderburg 2021 ) , a Python im-3 . RESULTS Once our MCMC analysis was complete , we marginalized over most of our free parameters to yield constraints on the presence of exomoons and binary - planet companions as a function of moon m sin i and orbital period . Our constraints are summarized in Figure 2 , and our 1σ , 2σ , and 3σ limits are provided as Data Behind the Figure . We find that for all three planets , we are able to rule out most companions with m sin i greater than 2 M J in periods shorter than 5 days . In particular , our 95 % confidence limits for companions in periods shorter than 5 days are 1 .   three planets at 95 % confidence . Our constraints are stronger for short - period companions for two reasons : 1 ) the radial velocity signal scales with period as P −1/3 so longer - period companions induce smaller signals and 2 ) the sparse sampling of the RV observations causes poor phase coverage at longer orbital periods , making it more difficult to rule out all companions . The effects of the sparse radial velocity sampling is visible in Figure 2 as vertical spikes in both the posterior probability distribution and our 1σ , 2σ , and 3σ limits at specific orbital periods . The spikes become more prominent at periods longer than 5 days , reflecting the typical sampling of the dataset , which have observations on a few consecutive nights interspersed between years - long gaps without data .",338,205281835_3,

For blood , one test ( i.e. , one scanning experiment with three capillary tubes ) with a spiked trypanosome concentration of ~10 4 /mL was used ( no overlap with the data reported in Fig . 5 ) . For CSF , one test with a spiked trypanosome concentration of ~10 4 /mL in artificial CSF was used , and the sample was not spiked with WBCs as was done for testing . For each bodily fluid type , the images were processed using CMA with OFN followed by post image filtering and segmentation ( see Methods for details ) , and movies were generated for the first 4000 detected candidate spots . Two human annotators jointly viewed these movies and judged the existence of a motile trypanosome in each movie characterized by a slender body and rapid beating . The resulting label for each movie was either "" positive "" ( with a high confidence that there existed a moving trypanosome ) , "" negative "" , or "" uncertain "" . Multiple trypanosomes that co - exist in a single video are labeled as "" negative "" to avoid confusing the network during training . It was much easier to annotate the movies related to CSF due to the high quality of the holographic reconstruction in the clear medium ; whereas for blood , the resulting labels were mostly either "" positive "" or "" uncertain "" , because it was difficult to affirm that the movie did not contain a trypanosome . After manual annotation , only those that were labeled as "" positive "" were kept in training / validation . The "" uncertain "" and "" negative "" were discarded . This resulted in 3697 positive images for blood and 3890 positive images for CSF . Note that the movies are solely for the purpose of labeling , and the 2D maximum intensity projection ( MIP ) image patches resulting from CMA are used to construct the training / validation library . The images were then randomly split into training and validation sets using a four - to - one ratio .

It is also important to note that in this study we considered observed flow as the reference against which to evaluate model output results ; however , observed flow and observed flow regime indicators suffer from considerable uncertainty as well ( Westerberg and McMillan , 2015;Westerberg et al . , 2016 ) .

The peak of the distribution lies near 10 −10 , much below the central experimental value we have used indicating that our model does not provide a good fit to this observable . Large deviations in δa µ are found for light sleptons and neutralinos / charginos , this is why a better fit to the data is found for low values of M 2 and Ml . This is illlustrated in Fig . 7a , b. This observable also plays a role in setting the upper limit on the neutralino / chargino masses . Note that if δa µ turns out to be consistent with the SM prediction , as indicated by some preliminary results [ 39 ] , the distributions for M 2 , Ml would shift to larger values . The dependence of the B - observables on some of the most relevant parameters are displayed in Fig . 7c   The predictions for the neutralino nucleon elastic scattering , σ SI χp , vary over 5 orders of magnitude . The distribution peaks at values near the experimental upper limit , see Fig . 5 and can even exceed the present limit . The LSP mass dependent CDMS limit is displayed in Fig . 6a [ 2 ] . The light Higgs exchange in general dominate SI interactions . Therefore large cross sections are expected when the LSP has a large coupling to the light Higgs , this means some higgsino component , Fig . 6b , d. For example a LSP with a higgsino component f H > 0.2 necessarily implies σ SI χp > 3.2 × 10 −9 pb . These values will be probed in the near future with for example Xenon100 [ 12 ] . On the other hand a pure bino LSP has a cross section at least two orders of magnitude below the experimental limit . The second Higgs scalar as well as squarks can also contribute significantly when they have a mass comparable to the LSP . There is however no direct correlation between the direct detection rate and M A . Note that the enhancement of the heavy Higgs contribution relative to the light Higgs expected at large values of tan β is tamed because the pseudoscalar is always much heavier than the light Higgs ( recall that M A > 370 GeV ) .",420,4793709_8,

In data analytics , there is an unknown distribution µ on Z , and a random dataset S ∈ Z n drawn from µ ⊗n . Given a query space W and a function : W × Z → R + , the data analyst picks some query w ∈ W and wishes to evaluate the quantity L µ ( w ) = E [ ( w , Z ) ] under Z ∼ µ. There is an answer - generating mechanism holding the dataset S , which accepts the query w and returns an answer Y to the data analyst . By the law of large numbers ( assuming the function is bounded ) , there is a strong and uniform guarantee that the answer given as the empirical mean L S ( w ) = 1 n n i=1 ( w , Z i ) can well approximate L µ ( w ) for all µ. In practice , however , data analysis is often performed in multiple rounds in an adaptive manner : in the jth round , the data analyst issues a query W j based on the previously issued queries W j−1 as well as the answers Y j−1 received so far ; a new answer Y j is then generated based on the dataset S and the query W j . In this case , the queries W j for j ≥ 2 are no longer independent of the dataset S ; hence , the empirical mean L S ( W j ) can severely deviate from the true expectation L µ ( W j ) . The difference L µ ( W j ) − L S ( W j ) is called the bias of W j on S. An important problem in adaptive data analytics is to design answer - generating mechanisms such that the answers Y j are close to L µ ( W j ) under multiple rounds of interaction . Recently , ideas in differential privacy have been brought to bear on the problem of designing answer - generating mechanisms for adaptive data analytics [ 2][3][4 ] . In these works , the bias analysis is based on deriving generalization guarantees of differentially private algorithms . The accuracy of the answers can then be determined by combining the upper bound on the bias and the accuracy guarantee of the privacy - inducing mechanism . Compared to existing works based on differential privacy , the analysis based on mutual information pioneered by Russo and Zou [ 1 ] is simpler and provides information - theoretic insights on designing good answer - generating mechanisms that reduce bias and improve accuracy . Following the information - theoretic framework in [ 1 ] , we develop a proof using Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , which leads to an improved bound on the expected absolute error and a sample complexity bound for the absolute error to be small with high probability . Our proof also removes the jointly Gaussian assumption on the empirical risks .",539,233916124_63,

Recently , two independent studies described functionalized PEG - based hydrogels that also support the growth of intestinal progenitor cells in 3D in vitro . [ 22,23 ] Compared to BME , synthetic PEG hydrogels , however , have certain disadvantages . Gjorevski et al . reported the necessity of two different PEG hydrogels for intestinal organoid growth : a stiff nondegradable PEG gel that promotes intestinal stem cell expansion as spheroids , and a soft and hydrolyzing PEG gel that constrains stem cell proliferation but triggers differentiation into the functional cell types of the intestinal epithelium .   The PEG - based hydrogel described by Cruz - Acuña et al . required initial expansion of pluripotent progenitor cells in 2D cultures on a layer of BME , and differentiation of 3D spheroids into functional intestinal epithelial cells was only demonstrated after in vivo transplantation into mice . In addition , the expansion of human pluripotent stem cell - derived spheroids [ 23 ] required very different physical properties than the expansion of murine adult stem cell derived spheroids , [ 22 ] indicating that each PEG hydrogel formulation is limited to a narrow range of applicability . Indeed , when we reproduced the PEG hydrogel described by Cruz - Acuña et al . , we found that it enabled growth of human liver and pancreas organoids , but did not support expansion of murine small intestinal organoids .

648a441f1b9b678478ba199a,198355838,Advanced Energy Materials,9,"The TRPL spectroscopy measurement of perovskite films with and without ESMs / HSMs have been the subject of several studies [ 29 ] mainly conducted by Stranks et al . [ 29][30][31 ] as well as others . [ 32 ] Following absorption of a photon , an electron and hole pair is generated . Charge carriers can either recombine radiatively or be trapped by defects in the bulk and at the surface of the sample . Most of these trap states are shallow in lead - halide perovskites , which means the captured electrons and holes can be released in a short time scale in the range of nanoseconds . [ 3,4 ] This explains the long electron - hole lifetime in perovskite film . [ 33 ] Radiative recombination happens in a very short time , and normally appears as a power - law decay in the TRPL measurement , whereas the non - radiative recombination by monomolecular shows a monoexponential decay in the TRPL measurement . [ 30 ] It should be noted that the actual TRPL data of the same perovskite sample is highly influenced by the pulse fluence . [ 30 ] When the perovskite film is deposited adjacent to an ESM or HSM , the interpretation of TRPL data can be more complicated . First , electrons or holes can be extracted by the ESM or HSM and then lead to a decrease in PL intensity . The more efficient in charge extraction , the more efficient in quenching of PL intensity . Second , the ESM / HSM may bring some defects at the interface with the perovskite , which results in non - radiative recombination and leading to drops in PL intensity . The second role played by ESM / HSM has been confirmed by Stolterfoht et al . [ 34 ] who compared a range of ESMs and HSMs using the TRPL and absolute PL spectra measurement . However , it should be noted that these two roles played by ESMs / HSMs both involve a monomolecular process that leads to a monoexponential decay in PL intensity . Moreover , these two processes happen simultaneously and are connected . As a result , when we fit the TRPL curve with a monoexponential curve , the PL lifetime calculated from the fitting contains the charge transfer process as well as the non - radiative recombination process . The reciprocal of the PL lifetime refers to the overall rate constant of these two processes . A faster charge transfer process or increased non - radiative recombination will both lead to a shorter PL lifetime . Figure 3a shows the PL decay of perovskite film with and without top layers . We can observe a faster decrease in the PL intensity of the three HSMs compared to pristine perovskite film . In particular , the PL decay of perovskite films coated with   either DFS or FS , lead to a stronger quenching effect of the PL intensity compared to Spiro - OMeTAD . Steady - state PL spectra were given in Figure S11 , Supporting Information . It shows a clear decrease in the absolute PL intensity in samples : neat perovskite > Spiro - OMeTAD > DFS > FS , which agrees well with what is observed in TRPL measurement .

The optimal classifier varies with the adversarial budget , so there is a trade - off between accuracy and robust accuracy . ℓ ∞ adversaries : In Figure 2 , we illustrate this phenomenon for an ℓ ∞ adversary . We plot α(β , µ ) for Σ = I ( so · Σ = · 2 ) and taking B to be the ℓ ∞ unit ball ( so · B = · ∞ ) . In this case ( 4 ) has an explicit solution . For each coordinate z i , set z i = min(µ i , β ) , which gives y i = µ i − min(µ i , β ) , which makes the constraints tight . Thus , as β increases , more components of z equal those of µ , reducing the marginal effect of an additional increase in β . Due to the mismatch between the seminorms governing the data and adversary , the value of β determines which features are useful for classification , since features less than β can be completely erased . Without an adversary , all of these features would be potentially useful for classification , implying that human - imposed adversarial constraints , with their mismatch from the underlying geometry of the data distribution , lead to the presence of non - robust features that are nevertheless useful for classification . A similar observation was made in concurrent work by Ilyas et al . [ 39 ] .",396,233235046_19,

In this study , 77 patients received the cataract surgery and 41 patients a refractive error correction . However , almost 100 patients who needed cataract surgery did not receive cataract surgery . One of the reasons mentioned in the study is a shortage of workforce of delivering cataract surgery implying a health care input constraint . To explore the impact of this constraint for ICER estimates and optimal decisions in this example , we first estimated total costs and total labour costs for each of the two interventions based on the data presented in the study . Although the information presented in the study did not allow a precise estimation of labour cost per patient for the two interventions , we made a rough estimate of $ 20 per patient for cataract surgery and $ 10 per patient for the refractive error correction . These labour costs per patient translate into $ 55.6 ( 20/0.36 ) and $ 52.6 ( 10/ 0.19 ) labour costs per QALY gained . Assuming that optimal use of the constrained resource was being made in the trial on which the economic evaluation was based and plugging in these values in equation ( 9 ) yields a λ λ x ratio of 89.7 and adjusted ICER estimates of $ 5355 for both eye - care interventions . These values are substantially higher than the original ICERs and suggest that the GDP per capita threshold would be too lenient for interventions that require even a low amount of labour .

Figure 2 shows the radio - frequency dual - comb spectrum of the mid - infrared idlers resulting from a time - domain measurement of 1.1 s duration . The center optical frequency is 89.65 THz , which is mapped in the radiofrequency range at f shift = 25 MHz . The line spacing in the optical domain is f = 230 MHz , and in the radio - frequency domain is Δf = 0.03 MHz . More than 1050 comb lines , spanning 0.25 THz , are resolved with a transform - limited line - width of 0.9 Hz . The signal - tonoise ratio of one comb line is calculated as the maximum of the comb line divided by the standard deviation of the noise floor between two individual neighboring comb lines . The average signal - to - noise ratio for the comb lines across the full - width at half - maximum of the spectral envelope exceeds 1080 . We exclude the residual from the continuous - wave carrier from the signal - to - noise ratio determination . Our data acquisition system is limited to a maximum sampling duration of 1.1 s. Within this time limit , the signal - to - noise ratio scales with the square root of the measurement time .

Such intensity fluctuations are already present in the spectrum of each near - infrared signal comb , as shown in Ref . 25 . These fluctuations are induced by the interaction in the highly dispersive optical fiber between the pulse with a duration of 50 ps at the input of the fiber and the weak residual of the light of the continuous - wave laser .

Shape of the decay depends on the following parameters , which can be kept either free or fixed during the optimization routine : the donor fluorescence decay [ F(t ) ] ; the Förster radius , the bilayer thickness ( d ) ; the partition coefficients of donors ( K D ) and acceptors ( K A ) ; the reduced surface concentration of acceptors ( C A ) ; the domain radius ( R ) ; as well as the area fraction occupied by the domains in the bilayer ( A r ) . In order to decrease the number of local minima , the number of optimized parameters is reduced as much as possible . For instance , the output parameter of the domain radius was rather insensitive to changes of the input parameters K D and K A , as well as to moderate changes of C A in DOPC ( 49%)/Chol ( 25%)/Sph ( 19%)/DOPG ( 5%)/G M1 ( 2 % ) bilayer ( cf . the list of abbreviations ) containing small amounts of Cholera toxin ( CTxB ) [ 7 ] . By using the correct input values of K D = 6 and K A = 0.01 , the domain radius found was 8 nm , and the domains occupy 6 % of the bilayer surface . Interestingly , we have observed that reduction of K D from six to three shifted the position of the chi - squared minimum to R = 8 nm and A r = 12 % , while the increase of K D to 9 resulted in R = 7 nm and A r = 5 % ( cf . Table 1 ) . A variation of K A in the range ± 0.002 has not affected the shape of the decay , while a change of C A in the range ±10 % had a negligible impact on both R and A r . A low sensitivity of R to K D , K A and C A may open new possibilities and advantages for the data analysis : due to experimental difficulties to measure partition coefficients at the point of the phase diagram where the domains are not visible by a microscope , K D and K A can be measured at closest points of the phase diagram where the bilayer is microscopically phase separated and used at the point of interest as well . Values of K D and K A do not necessarily need to be the same as at the original point , but due to the low impact of partition coefficients on R , values of K D and K A being lower or higher than the true ones are not expected to influence the R estimation substantially . Similarly , reduced surface concentration C A can be estimated for the non - separated homogenous lipid bilayer by means of the Baumann - Fayer model ( see the section above ) and used at the point of interest . By this approach , the number of optimized parameters could be reduced to only two , i.e. , the domain radius ( R ) and the area fraction of domains ( A r ) occupying a bilayer . Table 1 . The table shows to which extent the input parameters of the partition coefficient for donors K D and acceptors K A and the acceptor surface concentration C A influence the optimized values of the domain radius , R , and the area fraction of the domains , A r .

In this paper we introduce a new class of jet substructure observables called collinear drop , which allows us to optimize the sensitivity to soft regions of QCD phase space from higher energy perturbative scales down to the confinement scale . We used techniques of jet grooming and jet shapes to give concrete examples of constructing collinear drop observables . In particular , we used multiple soft - drop jet grooming algorithms to select controlled internal jet regions by removing energetic , collinear particles as well as soft , wide angle particles . We work out the analytic description of collinear drop observables using the soft - collinear effective theory , and we provide theoretical predictions at next - to - leading logarithmic ( NLL ) accuracy . We also developed scale variation methods to estimate perturbative uncertainties for these observables that are compatible with transition regions . As a validation of the theoretical framework , we provide comparisons of soft - drop jet mass distributions between our theoretical predictions to Pythia simulations , which agree well at parton level , and were also contrasted with ATLAS data . We then compare analytic results of partonic collinear drop distributions to different Monte Carlo simulations generated by Pythia and Vincia . We observe interesting differences between Pythia and Vincia with collinear drop observables , indicating that they are useful experimental observables for testing and improving MC simulations . While in general the NLL SCET results are closer to the Vincia results , the reduced theoretical uncertainties expected at one higher order ( nextto - next - to leading logarithmic accuracy ) will be needed in order to utilize SCET to truly distinguish features of different parton shower event generators . We also demonstrated that collinear drop observables can be utilized to study hadronization in jets in a manner inde - pendent from underlying event contamination , and with different settings , can be also used as a sensitive probe of underlying event effects themselves . Thus predictions for collinear drop observables provide key probes of soft phase space that are useful both for systematic improvements of Monte Carlo event generators and for rigorous study of underlying event and non - perturbative hadronization , paving the road toward higher precision QCD results for hadron - hadron , electron - ion , and heavy - ion collisions .",431,154997156_23,

[ 17,[21][22][23 ] This enables a correlation of Raman signals to estimate the density of Se / S sites through chalcogen% = ( I t − I min ) /(I max − I min ) , where I max and I min represent Raman peak intensity at any given time t , at the start , and end of the etching , respectively , for WSe 2 , and vice versa , for SWSe peak . Since the reactive H radical concentration is orders of magnitude larger than the density of Se on the WSe 2 surface , we assume the concentration of H radicals stays constant throughout the process . Thus , the rate of Se etching ( removal ) can be estimated as dSe(t)/dt ≈ Se(t ) , i.e. , proportional to the number of Se sites left on the top surface ( see the red plot in Figure 3e ) . Following a similar argument and assuming that sulfur removal from the top surface is negligible ( since the radical energies are designed to be lower than the energy required to break WS bonds ) , while considering that the total number of Se , S , and chalcogen vacancies add up to the total number of possible chalcogen sites , the time response of sulfur species on the top surface can be written   the blue curve in Figure 3e . From the relationship of Se(t , % ) + S(t , % ) + V(t , % ) = 100 % , the concentration of vacancies can be calculated with respect to the processing time as shown in the yellow fitting in Figure 3e . We note that the time of 280 s after igniting plasma is marked as the start of the analysis for better data representation . The vacancy - rich time region from 280 to 400 s from the simulation matches very well with the qualitative analysis of the Raman trend from Figure 3d ( see details of the analysis in the Supplementary Information ) .",381,12394216_82,

The W − b pairs are chosen as in the previous section , but outside the top mass rage : |m bW − m top | > 30 GeV. We see that this distribution is also plagued by large combinatorial backgrounds . Another possibility is to try to isolate stop pair production . This has the same finale state as top pair production which ends up being the main Standard Model background once a b - tagging cut is applied ( see [ 18 ] for example ) .

Like the K117R mutation in motif I , the D203A mutation destroys ATPase activity ; however , unlike K117R it is thought not to impair ATP binding . Based on this it was proposed that FANCM 's motor activity is unnecessary for promoting DNA crosslink repair , which instead simply relies on a conformational change in FANCM brought about by binding ATP ( 12 ) . However , our data show that a D196N mutation in Fml1 , which is the equivalent residue as D203 in chicken FANCM , produces a null mutant phenotype with respect to cisplatin sensitivity .

[ 50 ] Briefly , for each eye , the last 4 min of steady state pressure and flow data for each step were averaged , and a power law regression was fit to the data according to Q = C r ( P / P r ) β P , where Q is the flow rate , P is the pressure , P r is the reference pressure , C r is the reference facility at P r , and β characterizes the non - linearity of the data . This model is used rather than the more common linear model , as it was shown that neither the assumption of pressure - independent facility nor of a finite flow rate at zero pressure are valid in enucleated mouse eyes . [ 50 ] We therefore consider the facility at a "" physiological "" pressure drop across the outflow pathway in vivo , IOP - EVP = P r = 8 mmHg , and C r acts as an indicator of the physiological facility . It should be noted that although C r represents the total outflow facility , which comprises trabecular facility and any pressure dependent components of unconventional outflow , the latter are relatively diminutive and hence C r is a good representation of the conventional outflow facility . Additionally , based upon population studies , the distribution of outflow facility data is more accurately represented by a lognormal distribution ; therefore , outflow facility values are expressed as C x /ME 95 , where ME 95 is the 95 % margin of error , such that the 95 % confidence intervals can be calculated as [ C / ME 95 , C×ME 95 ] .

In the review of the literature , we detail how different forms of social capital could contribute to shape deaths and hospitalizations through three distinct mechanisms : by shaping the overall number of people who became infected , by shaping which individuals became infected , and by shaping the treatment received by those who became infected . Because social capital could determine the availability of tests that confirm the disease , the organization of testing facilities and the administration of tests given scarce resources , we decided not to examine differentials in the number of COVID-19 cases across areas with different levels of social capital . The number of infections are in fact especially likely to reflect differences in detection capacity rather than disease spread . Although differential detection could arguably also apply to the number of deaths recorded as being due to COVID-19 , measurement issues are likely to play a less important role . We corroborate findings on COVID-19 deaths with hospitalizations , but unfortunately the measure is available only at the state level , rather than at the county level . Other research has used data on excess deaths to account for differential reporting . However , we decided not to rely on a measure of excess deaths because COVID-19 led to profound behavioral changes which could have had an effect on the number of deaths due to other causes ( for example , individuals may have delayed seeking treatment fearing that they would be exposed to the virus in hospital settings or decreased mobility reduced motor vehicle fatalities ) . Such behavioral changes could have been associated with social capital , thus influencing estimates associations . A second limitation of our study is that , in the absence of data at the county level on interpersonal trust , our measure of cognitive social capital remains a crude proxy for the norms of trust and reciprocity that characterize different communities and findings should therefore be interpreted in this light . It is possible that broader measures of cognitive social capital that better capture the contribution of cognitive aspects of social capital to long - term behavioral changes that reduce COVID-19 transmission and fatality could yield different results . Finally , our analyses are descriptive and can not be used to prove causality but , rather , identify if the differences in the outcomes experienced by different counties with similar socio - demographic and economic profiles were systematically related to the levels of cognitive and relational social capital existing in such counties .",442,52883486_154,

First , a Csy complex forms that contains a crRNA with the priming spacer that guides the complex to the invader dsDNA ( 26,29 ) . The lack of a consensus PAM ( and possibly other protospacer mismatches ( 15 ) ) is likely to result in weak / infrequent binding of the Csy : crRNA complex to the protospacer target strand in the invader and causes the formation of an R loop with the non - target strand displaced ( 38 ) . After R loop formation , the native Cas2 - 3 hybrid protein , in an adaptation complex with Cas1 ( 26 ) , is recruited to the displaced ssDNA nontarget strand , potentially via Csy1 ( 26,(39)(40)(41 ) . Cas3 proteins possess adenosine triphosphate - dependent helicase activity and unwind dsDNA in a 3 -5 direction , while the HD nuclease domain cuts the translocating strand ( 41)(42)(43 ) .

This could account for the preferential location of protospacers 5 of the primed protospacer on the non - target strand . Whether this new spacer is derived from dsDNA or from one or the other strand is not known . We hypothesize that the helicase activity and movement of the Cas1 : Cas2 - 3 complex along the non - target strand in the 3 -5 direction results in the displacement of the target strand , and this ssDNA might aid the recruitment of Cas1 : Cas2 - 3 complexes that will translocate in the 3 -5 direction on the target strand ( 41 ) . Since the target strand begins to be exposed as ssDNA 3 of the primed protospacer , the acquisition of new spacers that target this strand initiates 3 of the primed protospacer and proceeds in the 3 -5 direction . This would result in the target strand protospacer distribution we observe ( Figures 7B   and 8D ) , where protospacers are present on either side of the primed location , but still with a preference towards the 5 on the target strand . The molecular details of this model will require testing in future studies .",424,236221457_17,
648a4fb11b9b678478f7c2cf,15534684,International Conference on Learning Representations,1,"A popular approach for learning representations is to fit a probabilistic latent variable model , an approach also known as analysis - by - synthesis ( Yuille & Kersten , 2006;Nair et al . , 2008 ) . By learning a generative model of the data with the appropriate hierarchical structure of latent variables , it is hoped that the model will somehow uncover and untangle those causal sources of variations that we happen to be interested in . However , without further assumptions , representation learning via generative modeling is ill - posed : there are many different possible generative models with different ( or no ) kinds of latent variables that all encode the same probability density function on our observed data . Thus , the results we empirically get using this approach are highly dependent on the specific architectural and modeling choices that are made . Moreover , the objective that we optimize is often completely disconnected from the goal of learning a good representation : An autoregressive model of the data may achieve the same log - likelihood as a variational autoencoder ( VAE ) ( Kingma & Welling , 2013 ) , but the structure learned by the two models is completely different : the latter typically has a clear hierarchy of latent variables , while the autoregressive model has no stochastic latent variables at all ( although it is conceivable that the deterministic hidden units of the autoregressive models will have meaningful and useful representations ) . For this reason , autoregressive models have thus far not been popular for the purpose of learning representations , even though they are extremely powerful as generative models ( see e.g. .",285,243862877_21,

It is important to note that while our model captures the main factors that determine the dynamical properties of information cascades , there are some variations in the trend across different years and different datasets , especially in the correlation between network structure and nodes ' activity level over time .

This outcome nicely corresponds to the other recent results of experimental research on conditionals discussed in Sect . 3 ( e.g. , Douven et al . , 2018;Krzyżanowska & Douven , 2018;Skovgaard - Olsen , Collins , et al . , 2019 ) and may be viewed as a development or another step of the project pursued by these authors . Not only the general inferential link , but also a more specific form of this link is a part of what is semantically expressed by a conditional utterance in a context . Our findings , in turn , point in a different direction than the one suggested by the earlier - mentioned studies which reported little effect , if any , of the connection between a conditional 's subclauses to its acceptability ( e.g. , Oberauer et al . , 2007 ) . The results of those studies seemed to provide support for a theory saying that the link between a conditional 's subclauses is not a part of its truth - conditional content . Our experiment provides a challenge for such a theory , which is to explain why specific links are nonetheless treated as a part of the truth - conditions of a conditional in a context . Based on our findings , one may be tempted to say that they , in fact , provide evidence against those theories which deny that the link requirement is a part of the lexical meaning of conditionals ( such as , for instance , the truth - functionalist view or the suppositional theory ) . However , we should be careful with such conclusions . Firstly , our results suggest that specific links do not arise in the way characteristic for conversational implicatures . But conversational implicatures may not be the only candidate for a pragmatic account of the links and perhaps the right pragmatic account has not been found as yet . Secondly , in order to establish the conclusion that specific links are semantic in a decisive way , one needs to conduct more linguistic tests of various kinds which would likewise confirm their semantic character . Finally , as we have already noted , our results pose a challenge to Gricean account of specific links and , in general , to the approaches which attempt to derive these links from conversational principles . Hence , the presented data - even if valid - may not refute the aforementioned theories of conditionals themselves , but only suggests that any such theory should incorporate essentially different mechanisms from the Gricean ones in order to account for specific links . In the next section , we will show how specific links can be accounted for as semantically relevant without abandoning standard semantic analyses of ' if - then ' and this proposal will appeal to an important contemporary view of the boundary between semantics and pragmatics .",505,235710470_27,

Good agreement is found with the measured diffuse PAR using the data from Lanna weather station for the period 2018 - 2020 ( Weslien , 2020 ) . It has to be pointed out that the model developed by Gu et al . ( 1999 ) requires the calculation of the hourly diffuse horizontal transmittance calculated as the ratio between horizontal diffuse radiation and global horizontal radiation . Due to the lack of measurements at the weather station of the diffuse horizontal radiation , the diffuse horizontal radiation was calculated through the decomposition model developed by Paulescu and Blaga ( 2016 ) . The decomposition step naturally introduces some errors in the validation , nevertheless , the model developed by Paulescu and Blaga ( 2016 ) showed high accuracy in Campana et al . ( 2020 ) as compared to other hourly and 1 - minute decomposition models .   A straightforward sensitivity analysis showing the interrelationships between crop yield , specific electricity production , and mutual row distance is provided in Figure 8 by varying the mutual row distance between 5 and 20 m. In general , from a mutual row distance of 5 m to 20 m the crop yield doubled . The maximum oat and potato yield without shading effect were 5.1 t / ha and 9.9 t / ha , respectively . A cross validation with the commercial software PVsyst ® was also performed to further analyse the error in electricity production with the model implemented in this study . In Figure 8 , a good agreement between simulated value and the value obtained from the commercial software can be observed . The crop model validation in terms of specific yield ( t / ha ) is provided in Figure 9 using Mesan ( 2021 ) and Strång ( 2021a ) data as climatological input data . The percentage error is 14 % as compared to the actual yield measured in the farm where the Lanna weather station is located and 6 % as compared to the county statistics . It has to be pointed out that the crop yield has been calculated with Mesan and Strång data and not with actual climatological data . Mesan and Strång are mesoscale models that covers the Nordic countries and the current resolution is 2.5 km . The use of input data from mesoscale models introduces an intrinsic error in the calculation of the crop yield as compared to using climatological data from weather stations . By way of example , the reader can refer to the average error statistics for hourly and daily simulations for Strång ( 2021b ) . The crop yield validation for potato was performed in Campana et al .

A common variation resulting in replacement of leucine 581 by proline ( L581P ) is the polymorphism most highly associated with higher fasting plasma glucose and lower plasma glutamine . To determine whether this association is the result of higher glutaminase flux , we genotyped cryopreserved human hepatocytes and identified 6 lots heterozygous for the L581P allele ( L581L / P ) and 6 lots homozygous for the major 581L allele ( L581L / L ) that were matched for available donor characteristics . Hepatocytes from L581L / P donors exhibited greater glucose production than control hepatocytes under basal conditions or after treatment with glucagon ( Figure 4a ) . Incubation of GLS2 L581L / P hepatocytes with [ U-13 C]glutamine and unlabeled lactate and pyruvate resulted in both more rapid labeling and greater enrichment at steady state than homozygous L581L / L hepatocytes of multiple TCA and gluconeogenic intermediates ( Figure 4b - h ) . This increased labeling of TCA intermediates occurred despite equivalent fractional enrichment in intracellular glutamine , implicating a higher rate of glutamine to glutamate flux in the L581L / P hepatocytes . To confirm that GLS2(L581P ) is a gain - of - function mutation , we over - expressed either GLS2(WT ) or GLS2(L581P ) in immortalized human hepatocytes and measured intracellular glutamate levels .

As new project ideas require partners to adjust to a sustainable business model ( De Silva et al . , 2019 ) , we deduce that partners are likely to require at least 3 years for any social innovation outcome to be realized . But this theoretical justification is not strong enough . We , therefore , also looked at the distribution of the data to determine what serves as limited or extensive relational experience in CSI projects . The average duration of the projects was 1212 days and the median was 1095 days (= 3 years ) . For the calibration , we therefore used the value of 3 years ( 1095 days ) as the cross over point .

The magnetic polar caps of MSPs , thought to be heated by ( return ) currents in the pulsar magnetosphere , produce thermal emission in the soft X - ray band ( Harding & Muslimov 2002 ) . As the MSP rotates , this emission gives rise to perceived pulsations , and relativistic effects encode information about the spacetime into the phase - energy resolved pulse - profile . 2 Pulse - profile modeling employs relativistic ray - tracing and Bayesian inference software to jointly infer mass and radius ( see Bogdanov 2016;Watts et al . 2016;Watts 2019 , for an overview of the technique ) . Riley et al . ( 2019 ) jointly estimated the mass M and radius R eq of the MSP PSR J0030 + 0451 conditional on NICER X - ray Timing Instrument ( XTI ) photon event data curated by Bogdanov et al .

The results derived are also conditional upon the modeling choices made in the analysis , e.g. , : the assumption of two disjoint surface hot regions , each with some local comoving effective temperature field but no magnetic field physics ; a fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere ; and a specific parameterization of the uncertainty in the NICER XTI instrument response . 3 The restriction to two disjoint hot regions was motivated by the presence of two distinct pulses in the observed pulse profile . Riley et al .

648a4abe1b9b678478dfedd4,14501396,BMJ,32,"This large population based dataset allows the robust investigation of rare perioperative complications , like perioperative ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction . Because any absolute increase in risk incurred by those who receive a transfusion would be quite small , these conclusions might not have been demonstrable with a smaller cohort . Indeed , the largest published randomized controlled trials of transfusion thresholds in surgical patients have not found a significant increase in rates of perioperative stroke / myocardial infarction . 22 23 Our findings , however , were robust across two independent statistical methods ( that is , hierarchical logistic regression and propensity matching ) and among many subgroup and sensitivity analyses . Furthermore , although it is not perfectly representative of the US population , the dataset we used includes a diverse variety of hospitals : urban and rural , community focused through tertiary care , and teaching and non - teaching hospitals . It also is not limited by type of health insurance . Accordingly , these findings are likely to be generalizable to a broad perioperative population . Our study has some limitations that should be considered when our findings are interpreted . First , as this   is an analysis of administrative data , detailed clinical data were not available . For example , no preoperative ( or postoperative ) measurements of hemoglobin are recorded in the dataset . Preoperative anemia is an important risk factor for perioperative complications , probably caused by comorbid medical conditions and/ or as a marker of frailty , though recent research has shown that direct effects of preoperative anemia might be weaker than the impact of mediating factors for adverse outcomes , such as transfusion . 24 Although we used a validated method of identifying some patients with anemia through the use of Elixhauser comorbidity coding from ICD-9 codes , this could undercount patients with pre - existing anemia . Furthermore , the accuracy of ICD-9 codes depends on the accuracy of collection of administrative / billing data , 25 a limitation common to large database cohort studies such as this one . As part of its business model , however , Premier undertakes a number of coding validation activities to ensure the cross site consistency and accuracy of data collected in Perspective . The rate of stroke / myocardial infarction events we observed ( 0.51 % ) is quite similar to the 0.44 % event rate observed in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program clinical dataset , 2 suggesting that Premier 's quality assurance procedures are effective . Though we had no information on transfusion thresholds or institutional policies regarding transfusions , we attempted to account for variation in practices between institutions by using hierarchical modeling . We also could not adjust for the indication for transfusion ( for instance , symptomatic anemia v ongoing blood loss ) and could not use the timing of the transfusion ( for instance , intraoperative v postoperative ) as a surrogate as transfusions were not time stamped within this dataset . Because we had no hemodynamic data , there was also no way to ensure that transfusions were not given as a response to hypotension as a result of hemorrhage , which would potentially increase the risk for stroke or myocardial infarction independently of the transfusion itself , although we attempted to minimize this potential confounder by subgroup analyses . Activation of hemostatic mechanisms can occur in proportion to operative trauma and blood loss ( and thus in proportion to transfusion ) , which could confound the relation between stroke / myocardial infarction and transfusion . Finally , we could not ensure that transfusions did not occur after an early ( that is , on the day of surgery or the day after ) myocardial infarction or stroke ; however , a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients who underwent transfusion on the day after surgery yielded similar results .",659,22551585_13,

The probabilities for a coin toss , for example , depend on how the properties of the coin and the tossing mechanism are modeled . That some particular physical model is suitable for giving rise to the proper frequencies needs to be judged by an agent .

This magnitude of power density , and the rapid charge / discharge times , would be competitive with electrochemical capacitors .

We searched archival data of the following surveys : the NRAO VLA Sky Survey ( NVSS ; Condon et al . 1998 ) , the VLA Sky Survey ( VLASS ; Lacy et al . 2016 ) , the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey ( WENSS ; Rengelink et al . 1997 ) , and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Sky Survey ( TGSS ; Intema et al . 2017 ) . From the search , we identified only one point source in the VLASS image ( 2−4 GHz frequency band ) above the 5σ noise threshold ( ≈ 0.6 mJy beam −1 ) . In the Canadian Initiative for Radio Astronomy Data Analysis VLASS Epoch 1 Quick Look ( CIRADA VLASS QL ) Catalog ( Gordon et al . 2020 ) , this source is cataloged as VLASS1QLCIR J095756.10 + 684833.3 with R.A = 09 h 57 m 56 s and Dec.= +68 d 48 m 33 s ( Source 4 in Figure 3 ) .

Using the 5 - σ upper - limit from the NVSS image ( 1.4 GHz ) of the FRB field - of - view of 2.15 mJy beam −1 and assuming a power - law dependence of the source flux density i.e. , S ν ∝ S α , we estimated a lower limit α > −0.61 . Note that the VLASS calibrated images are known to have a systematic that underestimates the flux density of identified sources by ∼ 10 % ( Gordon et al . 2020 ) . Incorporating this in our spectral index estimate would increase the derived lower limit . Active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) are known to show variable light curves at all frequencies . Given a ≈ 20 - yr gap between the NVSS and VLASS observations , the derived spectral index upper limit is not constraining if the radio source turns out to be a background AGN .",389,46520151_22,

Charged leptons are produced in the decays b → cℓ − ν , b →cℓ + ν , and like - sign lepton pairs can arise when one of the b quarks yields a B 0 meson which oscillates before decay . Additionally , like - sign charged leptons can be produced from the subsequent decay of the charm ( anti)quark , e.g. c → sℓ + ν . We have investigated the relative contribution of the two sources by simulating with Pythia a bb sample of 25 million events with and without B 0 mixing . The number of dielectron and dimuon events ( requiring isolation and transverse momentum greater than 10 GeV ) is gathered in Table 7 . A quick look at these numbers reveals that about 80 % of like - sign dileptons result from B 0 oscillation .   It must be emphasised that the theoretical evaluation of the bb contribution to the like - sign dilepton SM background involves several uncertainties . The most obvious one affects the total bb cross section , which depends to a large extent on the generation cuts placed on b transverse momenta . A second one involves b quark fragmentation . We have used the Peterson parameterisation with ǫ b = 0.0035 [ 41 ] . With the default Pythia setting ǫ b = 0.005 the number of ( isolated ) dileptons obtained is a factor ∼ 0.77 smaller . But perhaps the largest uncertainty comes from the fact that our analysis relies on a fast simulation of the detector , which may be inadequate when studying delicate issues like lepton isolation . At any rate , a full simulation of a large bb sample is out of present reach and this background will have to be measured using real data .",338,89613132_47,

While the level of p62 protein in H460 cells was drastically decreased upon 6 - AZA treatment , the decrease was more subtle in H1299 cells , suggesting that the effect of 6 - AZA on p62 expression is different in different cancer cells ( Figure 1B , C ) .

The pioneer work led by the Connectivity Map ( CMap ) project has examined 1309 drugs with different doses in five cell lines to quantitatively measure drug induced gene expression profiles ( 17 ) . With such a rich resource , many studies implemented the concept of ' anti - correlation between drug and disease signatures ' for various drug related researches such as drug repurposing and combination ( 18)(19)(20 ) . The underlying assumption is that , for a query transcriptome , candidate drugs can be prioritized if such drugs have drug - induced perturbations ( as measured by gene expression ) in the opposite direction as the query transcriptome . With the rapid accumulation of transcriptomics data , this method has been adapted and applied in various cases . For example , in a study searching for candidate drugs that can be repurposed for schizophrenia , So et al . searched for drugs that induced ' anti - correlation ' gene signatures compared to the GWAS - imputed gene expression and interestingly , the set of candidate drugs they identified was significantly enriched with antipsychotics ( 21 ) .

Potential matching candidates are all NYSE - and NASDAQ - listed firms , which are not constituents of our S&P 500 - based sample frame . We consider key financial firm characteristics , namely firm size , market - to - book ratio , leverage and return on assets ( ROA ) , as well as the GICS two - digit industry affiliation , as matching variables ( Barber & Lyon , 1996;Clarke , Chen , Du , & Hu , 2021 ) .

Thus , sequencing errors substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation , even if sequencing errors occur at the low rate of 10 À4 -10 À5 across most of the genome .

The currents are set for each LED emitter to create similar brightness levels at our image sensor , ensuring that we adequately light the sample at each color , a requirement for obtaining color images . The green LED spectrum is inherently wider than the red and blue counterparts , and thus the spectral filters will reduce its intensity the most . Therefore , we operate the green LED at the experimentally determined maximum possible current of 5 A. The red and blue LEDs require a current of~2.2 A to match the intensity of the green LED on the image sensor to correct the white balance . We designed a circuit to control the necessary components of the device . The circuit is powered by either a 5 - V wall - mounted power supply or a cellphone charger battery pack . The circuit fulfills four major roles : providing power to the peristaltic pump , charging the capacitors for providing power to the LEDs , synchronizing the LEDs to the camera and creating stable , short , high current pulses , and , finally , providing an interface for remote control by a laptop using an Inter - Integrated - Circuit ( i2c ) interface for setting various parameters . The peristaltic pump is powered by a highefficiency step - up DC - DC converter at 16 V ( TPS61086 , Texas instruments ) , and its speed is controlled by a potentiometer via i2c components ( TPL0401B , Texas Instruments ) . The charge for the high - current pulses is stored in three 0.1 - F capacitors , which are charged using a capacitor charger controller ( LT3750 , Linear Technologies ) to 12 V. The capacitor charge is initiated by the image sensor flash window trigger signal , which is active during the frame capture , and its length can be controlled by the camera software driver . The charger controller acquires an "" on "" state and keeps charging the capacitors until the preset voltage level of 12 V is reached . During the short illumination pulses , the voltage on the capacitors decreases only slightly , and they are immediately recharged as each frame capture resets the charge cycle , thereby allowing continuous operation . The LEDs are synchronized and their constant - current operation is ensured by a triple - output LED driver controller ( LT3797 , Linear Technologies ) . The controller uses the same flash window signal from the image sensor to turn on the LEDs for the exposure duration set by the software . The current of each LED is controlled between 0 and 12.5 A using digital i2c potentiometers ( TPL0401A , Texas Instruments ) and is kept constant for the subsequent pulses by the circuit , thus maintaining the same illumination intensity for each holographic frame . During startup , it takes~3 - 4 frames for the circuit to stabilize at a constant light level . To avoid having multiple devices with the same address on the i2c line , we included an address translator ( LTC4317 , Linear Technologies ) to interface with the potentiometers controlling the red and blue LEDs . To control the circuit , the laptop communicates with an   Fig . 7 The algorithm used for object segmentation and deep learning - based hologram reconstruction in our field - portable imaging flow cytometer is illustrated .

During the initial startup , the circuit consumes~1 A for the first~8 s until the capacitors are fully charged . During its operation , the circuit consumes , on average,~370 mA with a pump speed setting of 100 mL / h and a frame rate of 3 frames per second . This yields an average power consumption of less than 2 W. In addition , the image sensor 's typical power consumption is~2.8 W according to the manufacturer 's data .",746,49183948_1,

The absorption and steady - state photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of samples containing either PdOEP or DPA , or the DPA / PdOEP mixture match the spectra of corresponding solutions well ( Figure 3a and Figure S6 , Supporting Information ) , [ 17 ] demonstrating that the inclusion process did not affect the electronic properties of the chromophores . The dynamics of the characteristic blue DPA fluorescence at 431 nm and red PdOEP phosphorescence at 666 nm were studied using time - resolved PL spectroscopy and provided insights about the location of the dyes . The time - resolved intensity decay of the blue DPA emission shows a biexponential behavior in nanodroplet - containing polymers comprising either both dyes or DPA only ( Figure 3b ) . This suggests the coexistence of two subpopulations of emitters having characteristic PL lifetimes of ≈6 and ≈14 ns , respectively . The faster lifetime is similar to the one observed for a DPA solution in BMB ( 7.2 ns , Figure 3b ) , whereas the longer decay appears to be associated with aggregated DPA molecules embedded in the rigid matrix . The relative contributions of the two decay components obtained from biexponential fits of the data indicate that ≈35 % of the emitter molecules reside in the liquid phase . Their majority appears to be included in the solid matrix , where they neither contribute to nor hamper the TTA - UC process because the sensitizer molecules appear to reside predominantly in the liquid phase ( vide infra ) .",339,52071146_1,

The largest values represent the unlikely case of transition moments oriented nearly along a line between the two dyes . Statistically this is an extremely unlikely orientation . It is definitely ruled out in the case of intercalated EB and stacked DH . From the structure of yeast tRNAPhe the transition moments are likely to be arranged as parallel stacks rather than linear . This consideration indicates that the distance is likely to be closer to the lower limits of R given in Table IV . A more realistic estimate of the measured distance is around 35 ± 3 A. We have assumed that the dansyl residue is stacked on the 3 ' end . This is consistent with the dansyl spectral and polarization data cited earlier . Using the published models of the structure of yeast tRNAPhe as a guide ( 9,10 ) , the distance between EB intercalated between base paired residues 6 and 7 and DH stacked over the adenosine residue at the 3 ' end is between 33 and 34 A. The flexibility of dye attachment at the 3 ' end would offer a var-0 iation of about 2 A in the distance .

As discussed in the introduction , it is a rare occurrence to know the toric diagram corresponding to a given quiver . The Forward Algorithm [ 10 ] can be used to extract the toric data for simple quivers , but it is computationally prohibitive for quivers with many nodes . So knowing the toric data dual to an infinite number of quivers is highly nontrivial . Finding the toric data for the X p , q theories is straightforward , since we can use our intuition from dP 2 to simply write down the answer and then check that it is correct . First , we note two different toric presentations of the space Y p , q ; these are given in Figure 11 . The toric data on the left is the presentation used in [ 9,11 ] ; the toric data on the right is simply an alternate projection which is particularly useful for our purposes 2 . Notice that for a given p , the only point that moves is the point along the left edge of the lattice . As q decreases , this point moves up ; at q = 0 we recover the expected parallelogram for Y p,0 . The toric data for X p , q is now easy to intuit .

648a42a11b9b678478ac780e,48352871,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,20,"Fundamental to many of the processes underlying ECM reorganization and fibrosis in HTN is activation of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) . ECM MMPs and TIMPs may contribute to the profibrotic phenotype in HTN . Activated MMPs degrade collagen , elastin , and other ECM proteins , resulting in a modified ECM , often associated with a proinflammatory microenvironment that triggers a shift of endothelial and VSMCs to a more secretory , migratory , and proliferative phenotype , which contributes to fibrosis , calcification , endothelial dysfunction , and increased intima - media thickness , further impacting on vascular remodeling and arterial stiffness [ 12 ] . In endothelial cells cultured in MgD medium , a significant increase in expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 has been reported . Also , MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been associated with alterations of the vascular wall in Mg 2 + -deficient rats [ 66 ] . In addition , there is evidence that the addition of Mg - sulfate effectively attenuated MMP-9 activity in a human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell line [ 67 ] . These data are confirmed by K. Kostov et al . who find that in patients with essential HTN there was a moderate negative correlation of serum Mg 2 + with MMP-2 ( r = −0.318 , p = 0.013 ) . There was a similar correlation of Mg 2 + with MMP-9 in patients with HTN and T2D ( r = −0.376 , p = 0.003 ) . The results show that lower and higher serum Mg 2 + levels correlate inversely with MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in HTN [ 68 ] . It is noteworthy that in Mg 2 + -deficient endothelial cells , MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity overrides the inhibitory effect of TIMP-2 , which probably is induced as an attempt to counterbalance the effects of the proteases [ 66 ] . A nuclear factor ( NF)-κB - binding site is present in the promoter of the MMP-9 gene . It is therefore possible that low Mg 2 + availability might directly increase MMP-9 expression via NF - κB [ 66,69 ] . In cultured rat VSMCs , Mg 2 + significantly reduced the production of MMP-2 under basal and platelet - derived growth factor - stimulated conditions in a dose - dependent manner , while neither verapamil nor nifedipine showed any effect under the same conditions . These data suggest that the beneficial effect of Mg 2 + supplementation on vascular disease processes may be due , at least in part , to the inhibitory effect of Mg 2 + on the production of MMP-2 in VSMCs [ 70 ] . Evidence supporting this data is that in cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts , Mg 2 + significantly reduced the production of MMP-2 in a dose - dependent manner [ 71 ] . MgD may increase the activity of MMPs , including collagenases , which begin to degrade the extracellular vascular matrix and primarily collagen with an increased speed . The degradation of elastin fibers can significantly increase ( up to 2 - 3 times ) in the presence of Mg 2 + . MgD is associated with low elastase activity and an increased number of elastic fibers [ 63 ] . Altura et al . describe and other possible mechanisms by which MgD can affect vascular remodeling processes . They present new evidence for effects on platelet - activating factor , proto - oncogenes , and sphingolipids , e.g. , ceramide and sphingosine with upstream regulation in both VSMCs and cardiac muscle cells . These findings will be helpful in explaining many of the known cardiovascular manifestations of MgD , especially vascular remodeling seen in atherosclerosis and HTN [ 72 ] .",637,231677986_26,

Here , we calculate the Bayes factor in four available energy channels ( see Section 4 ) with 8 ms and 64 ms time bins , respectively . For the 8 ms time bin , the values of ln(BF ) are between 0.5 and 9.0 in each channel ( see Table 1 ) , and the total ln(BF ) value from each of the channels is about 19.94 in favor of the lensing hypothesis . But for the 64 ms time bin , the ln(BF ) is −0.5 during the first energy channel and in the other three channels it ranges from 4.0 to 9.0 . The total ln(BF ) value from each of the channels is about 19.56 , which is close to the value of ln(BF ) for the 8 ms time bin .

Labeled 1a and 1c aureochromes were kept at nanomolar concentrations assuming a prevalence of their monomeric state . At low concentration , we did not find any major light - triggered effect on homodimerization ( Figures 1B , 3B and Supplementary Figure   S1C ) . Hence we performed MST measurements only in the lit state . PtAUREO1c showed a high affinity interaction to PtAUREO1a with a K D of 240 ± 90 nM ( Figure 1C ) . Using labeled protein at a concentration about 5 times higher than the K D , we confirmed that the PtAUREO1a•PtAUREO1c interaction is equimolar ( 1:1 ) in vitro ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . In order to understand which part of the aureochrome affects the heterodimerization ability , we either used the PtAUREO1a bZIP - A ␣ -LOV - J ␣ or the A ␣ -LOV - J ␣ module with fluorescently labeled PtAUREO1c . The bZIP - A ␣ -LOV - J ␣ module interacts with PtAUREO1c with a K D of 450 ± 240 nM , indicating no major role of the N - terminal extension for heterodimerization , whereas the A ␣ -LOV - J ␣ domain alone lacks any interaction with full length PtAUREO1c in the lit state ( Figure 1C ) .

The estimated raw fidelity is as high as 0.95 ± 0.01 according to the definition F = Trρ meaρideal À Á , where Tr is the trace . This confirms that the generated biphoton quantum states are of high quality and approach to the ideal maximally entangled states . The error of the fidelity was estimated using 100 Monte Carlo calculations with the Gaussian random data generated from the experimental results . The deviation of the fidelity from unity was mainly due to the nonideal angle rotation of the waveplates . To achieve a high fidelity of greater than 0.9 , one should align the wave plate very carefully to minimize the angle error to be less than 2 ° in the experiment ( see the details in Supplementary Fig .

This luminosity can be reached at the early stage of the LHC in comparison with a projected integrated luminosity of 300 fb −1 in five years . This approach is based on a consecutive use of the endpoint method , an event filter and a combinatorial mass reconstruction method . It was found that reliable results are obtained only with a good starting point for the final fit and by rejecting a large fraction of the background . The first two methods are used to define five SUSY particle mass ranges for the final combinatorial mass reconstruction method in which all five masses are simultaneously fit and allowed to vary from event to event . The endpoint method therefore is used to get a preliminary estimation of the light SUSY particle ( χ 0 2 , l R , χ 0 1 ) masses and corresponding errors . These masses are then used with the mass relation equation constraint to construct the maximum likelihood distribution in the two heaviest - sparticle mass - plane for each individual event . An event filter combining the maximum likelihood distributions for all events in the data sample allows determination of the range of heavy ( g , b ) masses and significant suppression of the background . Finally SUSY particle masses are reconstructed by a search for a maximum of a combined likelihood function , which depends on all five sparticle masses , constructed for each possible combination of five events in the data sample .

We control for GDP per capita because it is associated with health and may reduce mortality , holding citizenship rights constant ( McKeown 1976 ) . We control for the percentage of the population aged 65 and older to adjust for the potential feedback effects of population health on social policy . Our models , however , assume the exogeneity of social policy , which might be a more reasonable assumption for OECD welfare states than for developing welfare states , since social policy generosity is on the decline in many aging populations , such as Germany and Sweden . Nevertheless , recognizing that there are still probably feedback effects from health to social policy , we include a control for the proportion of the population that is aged 65 and older , following the logic that social policy effects net of population aging should be less vulnerable to endogeneity . Finally , we control for public and private social expenditure because many welfare states use a mix of public and private supports . The differences between the expenditure data and the policy - based CWED data are that expenditure is "" downstream "" from policy , and the expenditure data capture private social spending net of the public spending that is uniquely caused by the policy - based measures also included in the models ( the OECD measure also includes several areas of social spending , including income supports , housing , and family supports , among other policy domains ; see Adema et al [ 2011 ] ) . We expect ( and find ) positive associations for all three controls . Data for public and private social expenditure are taken from the Comparative Political Dataset ( Armingeon et al . 2015 ) .

Fig . 3(Left ) shows the distribution of the wavy filament over the Galactic CO emission . Overplotted are the spiral arm models of Reid et al . ( 2016 ) . From the figure , it is evident that in the longitude range below 343 • , the emission matches well with the model of Norma spiral arm . In the longitude range 343 • -350 • , the velocity of the structure deviates from the Norma arm with maximum deviated velocity of ∼ 35km / s. Beyond 350 • longitude , the emission matches quite well with that of the 3 - kpc spiral arm model . The break in the wavy structure observed in the integration emission maps is also seen in the ( l , V ) diagram . A possible explanation is that the wavy filament is not a coherent structure and rather a superposition of features from Norma and 3 - kpc arms . In order to investigate this further , we have also generated Hi ( l , V ) diagram using SGPS data . Since Hi traces low density gas compared to CO , any connection should be prominent in the Hi plot . Fig . 3(Right ) shows the Hi ( l , V ) diagram . In the plot , the emission corresponding to the wavy structure appears very prominent in the Norma-3 - kpc inter - arm region . The structure appears to be branching out from the main Norma arm at longitudes beyond 340 • extending further towards the direction of 3 - kpc arm . This implies that the structure is not entirely confined to the Norma arm . The structure is 2 kpc in extent , excluding emission from the 3 kpc region . Even though the emission corresponding to the 3 - kpc arm at present appears to be disconnected from the structure connected to the Norma arm , the vertical oscillation seems to transcend this gap . Either the connection existed in the past , or the cause for the vertical oscillation does not require a physical connection of the gaseous structures , which would be the case for example , waves in the gravitational potential . The velocity distribution of the entire structure also shows fluctuations along the Galactic longitude , evident in the ( l , V ) diagrams .

Firstly , as in other studies using administrative data , we were only able to measure psychotropic drug poisonings that were related to receipt of medical attention , thereby underestimating the true impact of the warnings on suicidality because only about a third of suicide attempts are medically treated . 14 Secondly , we elected not to use deliberate self harm E - codes because they are incompletely coded across sites in the Mental Health Research Network and in commercial plan databases generally . 34 Thirdly , we elected not to use a validated algorithm 33 based on a combination of diagnoses of injury and psychiatric conditions , including depression , to avoid introducing ascertainment bias because previous research found that the rates of depression diagnosis declined after the warnings . 21 22 25 Instead , we used psychotropic drug poisonings to estimate changes in suicide attempts after the warnings . While the positive predictive value of psychotropic drug poisonings is lower than the abovementioned algorithm ( 79.7 % v 87.8 % ) , it outperforms other injury and poisoning types and has high specificity . 33 Given that each method only accounts for a small subset of suicide attempts , which are rare , we would not be able to detect any change in population level rates of suicide attempts by other means even with our large sample of 7.5 million . Because psychotropic drug poisonings account for about 38 % of suicide attempts , 33 36 our results underestimate increases in suicide attempts after the warnings . Further , our sample largely included insured populations ( commercial plans and public insurers ) ; the findings may not reflect behavior among uninsured patients . Our data sources did not have reliable information on socioeconomic status and race or ethnicity for the early 2000s , thus we did not stratify our analyses by these factors .

Note that our usage of "" intrinsic transport "" does not designate the doping state ( as in traditional semiconductor parlance ) ; it refers to the limiting transport if a bulk CNT material could be manufactured with perfect alignment , maximum density , zero impurities , and no junctions between CNT structures . The limiting transport is dictated by the individual CNT or , as argued here , possibly the CNT bundle . In this sense , the intrinsic conductivity can be enhanced by increasing the mean - free - path ( decreasing defect density ) , increasing carrier density ( by doping ) , and possibly making smaller - diameter bundles ( If , indeed , the full bundle cross - section is not used ) . Figure 11a shows the resistance versus temperature response of some specific cases of these intrinsic elements . Single crystal graphite , [ 79,342 ] an individual metallic SWCNT , [ 103 ] and a CNT bundle [ 154,376 ] have a completely metal - like increase in resistance with increasing temperature over the entire temperature range , typically from phonon interaction . [ 355,377 ] As intrinsic elements are assembled into a larger agglomeration , the resistance verses temperature response changes . Many FWCNT films of unaligned microstructure , [ 309 ] MWCNT materials , [ 378 ] individual MWCNTs , [ 139 ] and disordered graphite [ 379 ] have a completely semiconducting resistance response , from room - temperature to cryogenic temperature ( Figure 11c ) . This also includes unaligned films of predominantly metallic SWCNTs ; [ 172,329 ] though the CNTs individually are metallic , this does not mean the bulk material will have the standard metal - like increase in resistance with increasing temperature . Alternatively , more ordered materials , such as CNT cables with aligned microstructure , [ 15 ] less disordered carbon fibers , [ 320 ] and conductive polymers , [ 380,381 ] have a parabolic - like resistance versus temperature response ( Figure 11b ) . Here , there is a metal - like response at higher temperatures and a semiconductor - like response at lower temperatures with a minimum in resistance at the crossover . Figure 11d shows the conductivity versus the ratio of resistance at 300 K divided by the resistance at 10 K for material categories in this meta - analysis ; correlation data are provided in Table 24 . For the FWCNT materials , over a large range of conductivities spanning nearly 0.01 to 10 MS m −1 , there is significant positive correlation that is maintained after the weighted adjustment . For MWCNT materials , a consistent correlation is largely absent . These correlations in FWCNT materials demonstrate the importance of the metallic - like temperature response over the semiconducting - like temperature response , without adopting any specific transport mechanisms .",545,52804764_574,

RESULTS Figure 1 presents a selection of images of the continuum emission of PDS 70 at 855 µm , synthesized from the new ALMA observations combined with short baseline data ( LB19+SB16 ) . The disk is well detected with a spatially integrated flux density of ∼176±18 mJy ( all images give similar values ) . After deprojecting the image with an inclination of ∼51.7 • and a position angle of ∼160.4 • , we computed an azimuthally averaged radial profile and found that the outer disk resolves in a ring extending radially from ∼0.4 ( 45 au ) and ∼0.9 ( 100 au ) . The outer disk is not radially symmetric and shows a clear azimuthal asymmetric feature in the North West ( ∼27 % brighter at peak compared to the mean ring value ) , as already discussed by Long et al . ( 2018 ) and Keppler et al . ( 2019 ) . When imaged at high resolution , the outer disk resolves into a narrow and bright ring with a faint inner shoulder detected in the image at the 3 - 4σ level ( Appendix A.2 ) . To better assess the presence of such substructures , we model the azimuthally averaged radial visibility profile using the frank package ( Jennings et al . 2020 ) . Our analysis , presented in Appendix B recovers a double peaked profile for the outer disk . Such a substructure was already hinted in the data presented in Keppler et al . ( 2019 ) .

This blend exhibits a near - zero driving force ( ≈50 - 70 meV ) for the interfacial electron transfer process , as evidenced by our earlier work . [ 14 ] We employ femtosecond transient absorption ( TA ) spectroscopy to quantify the singlet excited state ( S 1 ) lifetime in pristine polymer films and the forward and backward electron transfer dynamics in DPP : PC [ 70]BM blend films . Then , CT state dissociation is studied using electromodulated differential absorption ( EDA ) spectroscopy . EDA spectroscopy enables us to track the separation of electron - hole pairs and their mobility dispersion at early timescales ( < 1 ns ) . On the theoretical side , we employ density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations to compute transfer integrals for the electron transfer processes at the heterojunction . We also gain insights into electron - phonon coupling ( EPC ) by calculations of the mode - resolved reorganization energy . Using those parameters , the electron transfer rates are predicted within a modified semiclassical Marcus - Levich - Jortner ( MLJ ) framework and compared to the experimental values , as extracted from the TA data using a four - state kinetic model , that also allows to simulate the effect of bulk and interfacial disorder . Our main finding is that while interfacial electron transfer is still ultrafast at near - zero driving force , CT dissociation is relatively slow , leading to competing recombination channels mediated by a short S 1 excited state lifetime via S 1 -CT electron back - transfer and hybridization .",337,32270800_46,

Since we are training for a local descriptor of a curve , that is , a function whose value at a point depends only on its local neighborhood , a negative example must pair curves such that corresponding points on each curve must have different local neighborhoods . One such possibility is to construct negative examples which pair curves with their smoothed or evolved versions as in Table 1 . Minimizing the loss function in equation 3 would lead to an action which pushes apart the signatures of the curve and its evolved or smoothed counterpart , thereby injecting the signature with fidelity and descriptiveness . We construct separate data - sets where the negative examples are drawn as shown in the rows of Table1 and train a network model for each of them using the loss function 3 . In our experiments we perform smoothing by using a local polynomial regression with weighted linear least squares for obtaining the evolved contour .

The target stars span comparable ranges of effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity , and the spectra exhibit comparable signal - to - noise ratios ( ∼ 50 − 100 per reduced pixel ) . As a result , the Na , Al , and Fe absorption line profiles of interest to the present work were equivalently resolved , and any stated abundance ratio differences between and within the data sets should only reflect random measurement uncertainties and intrinsic composition variations . Systematic abundance ratio differences are largely minimized by our selection of the data sets from the same investigator . Both studies used the same LTE line analysis code ( MOOG ; Sneden 1973 ) , equivalent width ( Fe ) and spectrum synthesis ( Na , Al ) techniques , the same absorption lines , and the same model atmosphere grids . The reported abundance ratios in both studies were also measured differentially relative to the standard giant star Arcturus , which should largely reduce systematic effects due to model atmosphere deficiencies , departures from thermo- dynamic equilibrium , and departures from the standard 1D plane parallel atmosphere assumption . We expect systematic zero point differences do not exceed ∼0.03 dex in magnitude .   ( Ness et al . 2012;Uttenthaler et al . 2012 ) . Figure 3 compares two typical examples of spectra , each representing stars in the Na - rich and Na - normal groups , which shows that the Na line strength variations are real . In order to further investigate this finding in terms of GC connection , in the lower left panel of Figure 2 , Na - rich and Na - normal stars are highlighted in different color coding in the referred metallicity range . The same color coding is then repeated in other panels for Al , O , and Mg abundances . If the bimodal Na distribution is due to the putative G2 + and G1 stars originated in metal - rich GCs , Narich stars should also be observed to be Al - rich although the difference in [ Al / Fe ] between the two groups is predicted to be substantially smaller than that for [ Na / Fe ] ( see Figure 4 ) . 2 This is clearly seen in the lower middle panel . Furthermore , unlike metal - poor GCs , G2 + stars in metal - rich GCs are not significantly depleted in O and Mg abundances ( δ[O / Fe ] ≈ 0.04 dex ; Tang et al . 2017;Muñoz et al . 2018;Kim & Lee 2018 ) , and therefore , to within the observational errors , we would not expect differences in O and Mg abundances between G2 + and Figure 3 . Example of the spectra for the two stars in Narich and Na - normal groups . Two spectra , each representing stars in the Na - rich ( red ) and Na - normal ( black ) groups , are compared for two pairs of stars . They have a nearly identical temperature , gravity , and [ Fe / H ] . Note the difference in Na line strength between the two spectra . G1 stars . This prediction is also consistent with the absence of apparent differences in [ O / Fe ] and [ Mg / Fe ] between the Na - rich and Na - normal groups in the right two panels . Similarly , no obvious chemical dichotomy is observed in other elements measured including Si , Ca , Ni , Co , and Cr . Therefore , all of these chemical patterns observed in the outer bulge are exactly consistent with the behavior we would expect from G2 + and G1 stars originated in metal - rich GCs .",693,235612911_98,

This is the same ejecta that initially generates the kilonova emission detected in the UV / optical / NIR bands . Compared to the relativistic jet , this ejecta component will decelerate on a significantly longer timescale due to its larger mass , ≈ 0.01 − 0.1 M ( Metzger & Bower 2014;Hotokezaka & Piran 2015 ) .

We find that models with p > 2.2 that match the X - ray emission overpredict the radio emission , ruling out the median value for cosmological SGRBs , p = 2.4 . A model with p = 2.2 matches our radio detection at 6 GHz . Upper right : Select model radio light curves explored in our simulations . Models with small θobs are ruled out by our 10 GHz upper limits , while models with large θobs are ruled out by our 6 GHz detections at 19 d and 39 d. Models with large EK are ruled out for all θobs because they predict that the radio and X - ray flux densities increase faster than observed between ∼ 10 − 40 d. Bottom : The regions of parameter space allowed by our radio and X - ray observations for typical SGRB jet kinetic energies ( assuming p = 2.2 and e = 0.1 ) .

In the homogeneous setting where agents hold independent and identically distributed data points , we investigate the choice of step size and number of iterations that guarantee each agent to achieve optimal statistical rates with respect to all the samples in the network . We build a theoretical framework that allows to directly and explicitly exploit the statistical concentration of quantities ( i.e. batched gradients ) held by agents . On the one hand , exploiting concentration yields savings on computation , i.e. it allows to achieve faster convergence rates compared to methods that do not exploit concentration in their parameter tuning . On the other hand , it yields savings on communication , as it allows to take advantage of the trade - off between statistical power and communication costs . Firstly , we show that if agents hold sufficiently many samples with respect to the network size , then Distributed Gradient Descent achieves optimal statistical rates up to poly - logarithmic factors with a number of iterations that scales with the inverse of the spectral gap of the communication matrix divided by the number of samples owned by each agent raised to a problem - dependent power , up to a statistics - induced threshold . Previous results for decentralised iterative gradient schemes in the context of consensus optimisation do not take advantage of the statistical nature of decentralised empirical risk minimisation problems . In the statistical setting that we consider , these methods would require a larger number of iterations that scales only with respect to the inverse of the spectral gap . Secondly , we show that if agents additionally hold sufficiently many samples with respect to the inverse of the spectral gap , then the same order of iterations allows Distributed Gradient Descent and Single - Machine Gradient Descent ( i.e. gradient descent run on a single machine that holds all the samples in the network ) to achieve optimal statistical rates up to poly - logarithmic factors . Provided the communication delay is sufficiently small , this yields a linear speed - up in runtime over Single - Machine Gradient Descent , with a "" single - step "" method that performs a single communication round per local gradient descent step . Single - step methods that do not exploit concentration can only achieve a linear speed - up in runtime in graphs with spectral gap bounded away from zero , i.e. expanders or the complete graph . Our results demonstrate how the increased statistical similarity between the local empirical risk functions can make up for a decreased connectivity in the graph topology , showing that a linear speed - up in runtime can be achieved in any graph topology by exploiting concentration . To the best of our knowledge , we seem to be the first to isolate this type of phenomena .",519,235368035_14,

As the reduction in bead - labeled macrophages in the Ntn1 −/− → C57BL/6 mice at day 14 is indicative of ATM emigration from the VAT , we isolated the draining lymph nodes from the mesentery and analyzed the number of bead - labeled cells in this tissue . The mesenteric lymph nodes of HFD - fed Ntn1 −/− →C57BL6 contained 40 % more bead - labeled cells than WT →C57BL6 mice at day 14 ( Fig . 5d , Supplementary Fig .   4b ) .

TheC AM - B3LYP values of Dd a and Dd b are in much better agreement with the experimental data than the B3LYP ones . R ikhaus et al . [ 13 ] argue that Dd a < 0a nd Dd b < 0a re an indication of the presence of ag lobal aromatic current ( while the opposite is evidence of an antiaromatic current ) . However , t his would indicate not only that c - P6·T6 6 + is globally aromatic , but also that c - P6·T6 is even more aromatic than the former , which is not supported by any other experimental or computational data . We have also calculated Dd a and Dd b in ab ound template in which we have eliminated the alleged current ( by removing the bridging butadiyne linkers ) , and we have found negative and positive Dd a and Dd b , w hich would support the presence of aring current even in the absence of connectivity among the porphyrins ( see Supporting Information ) . These results bring about two important conclusions . F irst of all , it reinforces the idea that CAM - B3LY P(or M06 - 2X ) are more adequate methods to obtain the geometry of potential aromatic molecules than B3LYP , w hich incurs large delocalization errors . Second , through various aromaticity probes , we have shown that the B3LYP geometry of c - P6 6 + corresponds to aq uite aromatic molecule with d o ' Àd o = À7.23 ppm , and Dd a = À12.26 ppm . Hence , ifthe corresponding experimental values are only À1.87 ppm and À2.83 ppm , respectively , this is clearly suggesting that c - P6·T6 6 + is either very weakly aromatic or non - aromatic , a st he CAM - B3LYP results indicate . This result is further reinforced by arecent finding [ 57 ] that the experimental aromatic stabilization energy of c - P6·T6 6 + is ca . 1.2 kcal mol À1 , w hich is relatively small for an aromatic molecule .",542,11177032_7,

From Figure 2 , we see that , for a notionally "" positive "" applied electric field , the head - to - head domain wall moves in a "" negative "" direction . This movement is against the field , and reduces the distance between wall and positively biased electrode through which the switching current develops . In the rest frame of the domain wall ( Figure 3c ) , the same event ( same relative movement between wall and electrode ) is reproduced when the conducting CGM tip moves toward the wall ( the electrode wall separation is reduced ) . Hence , the CGM current measured , when the tip moves toward the head - to - head wall , is the same sign as that of the switching current , in a conventional fixed - electrode field - driven switching experiment . Crucially , this current is measured to be negative ( Figure 3e , f ) ; moreover , it is the same , irrespective of whether the tip approaches the wall during the trace or the retrace scan . Its magnitude can be measured explicitly , as a function of the tip velocity ( Figure 4a ) . Equally , and importantly , the wall velocity as a function of applied voltage , determined through both optical and PFM imaging during The velocity associated with the anomalous field - driven motion of these head - to - head walls , as a function of switching bias applied to a positive surface electrode ( the main panel data have been determined from in situ scanning probe microscopy at room temperature , while the inset shows data taken from in situ optical microscopy , performed at 84 ° C , using geometries similar to those associated with Figure 2 and the Movies S2 - S4 , Supporting Information ) . c ) By combining data from ( a ) and ( b ) , the tip current ( at a given velocity ) can be expressed as a function of the switching voltage needed to induce the same relative motion between tip and domain wall . d ) Given that the wall velocities are constant in time ( for each driving voltage ) , the current - voltage relation given in ( c ) can be unpacked into a charge - time - voltage plot , allowing the capacitance to be explicitly determined , as a function of the time over which relative motion between electrode and wall occurs . e ) Since the wall displacement is a linear function in time ( the wall velocity is constant for each applied switching bias ) , the total charge collected at a sensing electrode can be calculated for different square pulse frequencies and hence modeled for more complex ac signals ( such as the triangular pulses in ( f ) ) . g ) The accumulated charge and hence negative capacitance can then be expressed as a function of ac signal frequency ( squares indicate capacitance and charge from square waveforms and triangles from triangular waveforms ) .

Armed with these two pieces of information , the form of the switching current obtained through CGM can be meaningfully mapped onto the applied bias that produces the same relative motion between domain walls and sensing electrodes ( during a conventional switching experiment ) .

Aligned with prison ethnography more broadly ( e.g. Drake and Earle , 2013;Ugelvik , 2014 ) , these observations ( made in research diaries ) were designed to produce rich and detailed accounts of people and the social processes and spatial contexts in which they were embedded .

Nineteen architects , landscape architects , contractors and justice sector professionals involved in prison design and construction were also interviewed across both contexts , and interviews took place in their offices . Within wide - ranging discussions about the design of all elements of a new prison , all interviews covered the inclusion , experience and significance of green spaces . Audio recordings were transcribed and analysed using NVivo , using an inductive coding method which sought to identify respondents ' descriptions of green spaces and their significance . An anonymous paperbased survey was also distributed at the UK prison ( n = 85 , response rate 22.6 % ) . Since green spaces were just one of a wide range of architectural design elements under study within a much broader overall project , we consider it unlikely that a biased sample of respondents ( i.e. those disproportionately interested in nature contact ) could have been recruited .",577,234494029_18,

This requires to implement a non - monotonic behavior and to consider large deformations . For this reason , we used the unit cell shown in Figure 3 that can expand as well as contract and assembled an array of 2×10 cells . The hinge thickness was defined in each cell so that the stiffness increases from left to right ( t 2 = t 2,0 + t 2,0 x , Figure 4c , middle right ) . The cells are connected in series ( with increasing local stiffnesses ) and in parallel ( with equal local stiffnesses ) . The non - monotonic , strain - dependent stiffness of the unit cell leads to a global stiffness minimum which moves through the material . The deformation of the structure starts on the left and migrates to the right when the stiffness of the left part increases . The non - uniform local strain leads to different lateral contractions in the cells depending on t 2 . Due to the local non - monotonic behavior of the single cell , a nonlinear , non - monotonic behavior of the system can be achieved . Figure 4d , middle right , shows the different surface morphologies , which can be controlled with this structure . If we choose the hinge thickness according to a sinusoidal distribution ( t 2 = t 2,0 + t 2,0 sin ( xπ ) , Figure 4c , right ) , the surface can even have two bulges that merge together after a certain strain ( Figure 4d , right ) . The variation ranges from wedged and warped to a plane surface shape although the design space is not widely explored yet . Videos of the FEM simulations of the two structures are provided as Videos S7 and S8 , Supporting Information . In the future , our homogenization and optimization framework shall be expanded to include large deformations , history dependency , and more geometric parameters to handle this complex behavior . Just like in the second example , the initial geometry as well as the amplitude of the global displacement can be used in this structures to program the shape . Moreover , the more complex unit cell geometry allows a larger range of target shapes possible within one sample . Producing such kind of materials is challenging due to their complex , inhomogeneous geometries and the difference in size between device volume and unit cell ( unit cell volume device volume < < 1 ) . A first approach was made by 3D - printing structures of a few unit cells , but there are still a lot of limitations like nozzle sizes and overall build volume . Nevertheless , we produced a demonstrator part made of the thermoplastic elastomer ( TPE ) Elastollan C78 A15 corresponding to the structure shown in Figure 4 , third column , with a linear distribution of the parameter t 2 ( see Section S4 , Supporting Information ) .

The results of this study can also help the respective government body to identify the concentration of air pollutants in each of the cities as a benchmark for and consideration of emission standards for air pollutants . Hence , Malaysia needs to design systematic policies based on pollution sources and characteristics in each city with the use of cleaner alternative and new vehicle technology , as most of the cites had air quality improvement with reduced vehicle numbers during the MCO period . In addition , each local authority can have its mitigation measures to reduce the air pollution concentration to be implemented on a small scale , which may eventually be expanded to a larger scale . Further studies on the effects of meteorology on air pollutant concentrations are highly recommended in order to further evaluate the variation of air pollutants for the pre - MCO , MCO and post - MOC periods .

This instrument is broadly useful for measuring functional impairment from acute and chronic illnesses , physical disabilities , cognitive disorders , and mental illness ( Sosa et al . , 2012 ) . It has been validated in 19 countries , including three sites in India . Reliability scores are high ; both Cronbach 's alpha and test - retest reliability coefficients are 0.98 ( Ustun , Kostanjsek , Chatterji , & Rehm , 2010 ) .

648a60bd1b9b6784787c18dc,212751883,Nucleic Acids Research,25,"Several groups including us have performed large scale affinity purification experiments coupled to mass spectrometry ( AP - MS ) using antibodies specific against dCenpA ( 17,19 ) , HMR ( 18 ) or HP1a ( 45,46 ) to identify putative interactors of these proteins . However , in contrast to other well characterized nuclear protein complexes such as the nucleosome remodelers or the histone acetyltransferases ( 47,48 ) , these three proteins have been refractory to classical biochemical purification . In fact , when comparing the AP - MS data from different laboratories the overlap in pro- teins identified is marginal ( 17)(18)(19)45,46,49 ) . We reasoned that this is due to the fragility of the interactions that do not withstand the harsh condition of cell lysis and subsequent purification . We therefore generated stable cell lines expressing HMR , dCenpA and HP1a fused to APEX2 that enables biotin labelling of factors surrounding the fusion protein ( Figure 2A ) . Upon treatment of APEX2 expressing cells with biotin phenol and hydrogen peroxide , a localized burst of diffusible biotin - phenoxyl radicals is gener - ated . These radicals then react with nearby ( < 20 nm ) electron rich amino acid side chains leading to the biotinylation of neighboring proteins that can be subsequently purified and identified using shot gun mass spectrometry ( 23,(50)(51)(52)(53)(54)(55 ) . We confirmed the expression of ectopic proteins by Western blotting using antibodies against HMR , dCenpA , HP1a ( Supplemental Figure S2A ) and APEX2 ( Supplemental Figure S2B ) . The APEX2 protein was fused to a double nuclear localization signal to determine the non - targeted nuclear proteome . Since the fusion proteins are expressed under a copper inducible promoter , we were able to tune their expression to match the endogenous levels ( Supplemental Figures S2A - D and S1B ) . Hence , we performed the biotinylation reaction under non - inducing conditions for HMR AP and dCenpA AP expression but induced the expression of HP1a AP ( Supplemental Figure   S2B - D ) .

648a61791b9b6784788762c0,1765194,Journal of High Energy Physics,65,"In this appendix we discuss what can be learned from the cumulative eigenvalue distribution ( CED ) . We consider both the eigenvalues in 4D generated for the main part of this paper and data from dedicated runs in the quenched Schwinger model ( QED with massless fermions in 2D ) to elucidate the effects that filtering and changing β have on the spectral density of the hermitean Wilson operator H W = γ 5 D W,−1 . Fig . 17 presents the cumulative eigenvalue distribution ( CED ) of the 15 smallest eigenvalues of |H W | on the ensembles discussed before . We show it both in standard form and in double logarithmic form , and the scale on the ordinate follows from the requirement that it would extend up to 1 , if all eigenvalues were calculated ( cf . Fig . 18 below ) . For the two intermediate couplings ( β = 5.84 , 6.00 ) we see the expected linear rise of the CED near the origin , which soon gets complemented by a higher order piece . The coefficient of the linear part is a measure for the spectral density of the hermitean Wilson operator at the origin , ρ |H W | ( 0 ) . That density being non - zero means that there is a finite probability to encounter arbitrarily small eigenvalues . The main effect of smearing is to reduce this spectral density , as is evident from the double logarithmic plots -here the initial slope 1 piece gets shifted downwards , and this corresponds to a smaller coefficient in front of the linear piece in the standard representation . Our data at β = 6.26 are of lesser quality -here we definitely can not identify a linearly dominated regime . The situation is far more favorable in Fig . 18 where quenched Schwinger model data are shown . Apart from the statistics , the main difference is that all eigenvalues ( extending up to ∼ 3 in 2D ) are included . The higher the filtering level or β , the more pronounced is the "" jump "" in the CED at λ ≃ 1 . Note that with a chiral kernel all eigenvalues of |γ 5 D kern | would be there , i.e. the CED would be a step function at λ = 1 . Finally , to come back to Fig . 17 , the situation at the strongest coupling ( β = 5.66 ) is different , since here the linear piece in the unfiltered CED is not larger than in the filtered versions . This is , because our choice ρ = 1 lets us "" loose "" the fermion -at this coupling our projection point is somewhere "" in "" the physical branch or "" to the left "" of it , while for the filtered version ρ = 1 is still appropriate . One might avoid such a situation by choosing a larger ρ with the unfiltered kernel , but an even safer option might be to refrain from simulating unfiltered overlap quarks on such coarse lattices . It looks like this is a situation where the filtered overlap may help a lot , since it allows simulations on coarser lattices than the unfiltered operator , but in order to really be useful such simulations should be in the scaling regime ( and not just in the right universality class ) , and this is , of course , not yet clear .",592,243802802_9,2

Examining the average value of health grants ( including zero ) per capita by type of county , our calculations show , in Fig . 2 , that large metropolitan counties receive a significantly higher amount than all other types of counties . In 2013 , for example , on average large central Fig . 1 Proportion of counties per the urban - rural classification , that received health grants metros received $ 2.50 per head in health grants from corporate foundations . This figure drops to under $ 1.00 for large fringe metropolitans , while medium , small metros receive approximately $ 0.25 per head , while micropolitans , and noncore counties receive even lower amounts per head . Again , there is a time trend over the years . In terms of value , even large central metros received less in 2017 compared to 2013 . Health grants per capita dropped from $ 2.50 per head to just over $ 1.00 per head .",339,227282001_40,2
648a60bd1b9b67847879d86f,22626104,Nucleic Acids Research,22,"Next , we tested whether the imino acid proline imposes the requirement for eIF5A. 80S initiation complexes were assembled on an mRNA encoding MPPPK and polyproline synthesis was monitored in reactions containing canonical Pro - tRNA Pro . In contrast to the MFF and MFFF peptides , which were well resolved during electrophoretic TLC , MPP and MPPP peptides co - migrated during TLC . Addition of a C - terminal Lys residue on the MPPPK peptide enabled resolution during TLC of the full - length tri - proline peptide from incomplete C - terminally truncated products ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . As expected , polyproline peptide synthesis showed a strong dependence on eIF5A. In the absence of eIF5A very little MPPPK was synthesized , and addition of eIF5A stimulated polyproline peptide synthesis ∼6.1 - fold ( Figure 1C , lane 6 versus lane 5 ; and Supplementary Figure S1C and D ) . Similarly , when misacylated Pro - tRNA Phe was tested for MPPPK peptide synthesis using 80S initiation complexes assembled on an mRNA encoding MFFFK , polyproline synthesis was stimulated ∼3.7 - fold by adding eIF5A ( end level = 0.08 in the absence of eIF5A and 0.30 in the presence of eIF5A ; Figure 1C , lane 8 versus lane 7 , and Supplementary Figure S1C and D ) . In control reactions , no peptide formation was detected when misacylated Pro - tRNA Phe was used for elongation of initiation complexes assembled on mRNA encoding MPPPK ( Supplementary Figure S1C ) , demonstrating that the observed peptide synthesis was not due to contaminating canonical Pro - tRNA Pro . It is interesting to note that the end level of the MPPPK peptide formation using misacylated Pro - tRNA Phe is lower than that obtained with canonical Pro - tRNA Pro ( 0.30 versus 0.49 , respectively ) , suggesting that the body of tRNA Phe is less effective for eIF5A - stimulated polyproline synthesis than is the body of tRNA Pro . Taken together , these data indicate that the imino acid proline and not tRNA Pro imposes the primary eIF5A requirement for polyproline peptide synthesis .",363,244651817_54,2
648a446f1b9b678478bb9c40,201062411,Science of The Total Environment,38,"The results of this study raise questions of the mechanisms behind the low levels of nitrification and resulting low N 2 O emissions from the urine patches in upland organic soils . Possible explanations for a lack of nitrification include a small or functionally inactive population of nitrifiers , high soil acidity , limited O 2 concentrations ( Allen et al . , 1996 ) , or some combination of the above . The detection of nitrification in the soil solution in one chamber suggests that the potential for nitrification exists in these upland peat soils . Nitrification rates , however , have been found to be lowest in moorlands and bogs in comparison to grasslands and woodlands , and are highest in arable and improved grasslands ( Yao et al . , 2013 ) . We suggest plant and microbial uptake were likely to be the main cause of the decline in soil solution NH 4 + concentrations in the urine treatments , with the decline occurring faster in the summer compared to the autumn treatments . The potential for NH 3 volatilisation was low due to acidic soil conditions , and leaching losses unlikely due to the limited build - up of NO 3 − in the soil solution . Complete denitrification to N 2 was also unlikely to occur due to production of N 2 O reductase being sensitive to low soil pH ( b6.1 ; Liu et al . , 2010;Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Soil acidity can influence the community composition of organisms capable of nitrification . At low soil pH , the protonation of NH 3 to NH 4 + occurs , and typically ammonia oxidizing archaea ( AOA ) dominate in environments with low NH 3 concentrations ( Stopnišek et al . , 2010;Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . Indeed , AOA have contrasting NH 3 acquisition systems and Fig . 5 .

Amendments were made on day 0 , symbols represent means ( n = 3 or 4 ) , error bars represent SEM and legends are specific to each column of panels . For panels a and c , asterisks represent significance levels of the analysis of variance . For panels b and d , black asterisks represent significance levels of t - tests for artificial urine compared to the control and red asterisks represent significance levels of t - tests for the NO 3 − and glucose compared to the control . ( For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend , the reader is referred to the web version of this article . ) possess energy - dependent NH 4 + transporters , compared to ammonia oxidizing bacteria ( AOB ) which have NH 3 transporters ( Offre et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , low soil pH has a greater negative impact on the abundance of AOB in comparison to AOA ( Yao et al . , 2013 ) . Extensively grazed acidic soils are likely to harbour greater numbers of AOA adapted to low NH 3 concentrations , as they do not receive fertiliser applications and inputs of excreta are minimal and ' patchy ' due to low stocking densities . The addition of urine to intensively managed grassland soils has been found to stimulate AOB , rather than AOA growth ( Di et al . , 2009;Podolyan et al . , 2014 ) , yet the response of AOA and AOB to urine events in extensively grazed systems are less well understood . We suggest that the high concentrations of urea within urine , which rapidly hydrolyses to produce high concentrations of NH 4 + in the soil , do not favour AOA growth , and the acidic conditions hinder AOB growth , resulting in limited nitrification from either prokaryotic domain . Soil hydrology can influence N 2 O sources and sinks ( Rubol et al . , 2012 ) , e.g. the higher the soil moisture , the lower the O 2 content , which would hinder the aerobic process of nitrification . In the individual chamber where nitrification was detected , the N 2 O - N EF was still only 0.06 % of the N applied , therefore , we suggest that the magnitude of nitrification may have been limited by additional factors . It is clear from our data that understanding the causes of spatial variability in nitrification rates are key to understanding the magnitude of N 2 O emissions from these upland organic soils . Enhanced understanding of the soils hydrology and the interactive effect of soil pH , aeration status and other soil characteristics on nitrification of urine - N would be useful to investigate the upper limits of urine - N 2 O - N EFs from extensively grazed peat soils .",860,14110389_71,2

648a61771b9b67847880d26c,245547826,Journal of High Energy Physics,95,"The QCD multijet production has a large cross section in pp collisions but a tiny acceptance in the phase space used in this analysis . Therefore , a very large sample of simulated QCD multijet events would be needed in order to retain a sufficient event yield surviving our selection criteria to ensure a reliable description of this background . In the absence of simulated event samples of the required size , an alternative approach is followed by defining an SB in data enriched in QCD multijet events . The SB is obtained by requiring the selected muon to have 0.2 < I rel < 0.5 and the selected electron to fail the tight identification criteria . The underlying assumption here is that the description of kinematic variables for QCD multijet events in the SB is similar to that in the signal region . We have verified this assumption using simulated samples . Shapes for QCD multijet events are derived by subtracting the total non - QCD con - tribution from data in this SB . As such , the SB data contain 93 ( 70)% QCD multijet events for the muon ( electron ) final state . The QCD multijet contribution in the signal region is estimated by means of a binned ML fit to the m T distribution with two components : QCD and non - QCD . As the QCD multijet background has a larger contribution in the 2J0 T category , this category is used to validate the above method . The procedure is then applied in the signal - enriched 2J1 T category where the background estimation is performed separately for positively and negatively charged leptons , as well as inclusive of the lepton charge in the final state .   and 2J1 T ( lower ) categories for the muon ( left ) and electron ( right ) final states . To account for possible differences between QCD multijet m T shapes obtained from the SB and that in the signal region , a separate 50 % systematic uncertainty is assigned to that background rate and shape ( see Section 8.1 ) . This propagated uncertainty is twice the maximum difference between the data and the prediction found in the tail of the m T distributions .",384,52941474_8,2

The M31 companions Cas III and Lac I , albeit somewhat fainter , share similar properties to those of NGC1052 - DF2 : their large half - light radii ( ∼ 1.5 kpc ; Martin et al . 2013 ) and velocity dispersion ∼ 10 km s −1 imply mass - to - light ratios ( M / L V ( r half ) = 8 +9 −5 and 15 +12 −9 , respectively ; Martin et al . 2014 ) that are entirely compatible with the constraint on NGC1052 - DF2 6 .

First , we identify the arising innovation trends during the first two months of the COVID-19 crisis utilizing machine learning to construct a topic model ( Maier et al . , 2018 ) based on web - scraped text data of 707 innovation projects related to the COVID-19 crisis ( henceforth , COVID innovations ) . In doing so , we contribute a novel procedure for characterizing large - scale innovation activities by employing the text mining technique of topic modeling using text data of innovation projects . Subsequently , we estimate the time trend of the identified domains of innovations over the two - month observation span using simple regression analysis to identify the rising and falling dynamics of the rapid - response COVID innovations . Second , and based on the derived structural model of innovation activities , we connect the different identified domains of innovations to a more latent classification of fundamental human needs , which is based on the contribution of Max - Neef et al . ( 1989 ) . Employing this two - stage approach , each crisis - driven domain of innovations is thematically characterized , and its occurrence is estimated over time . Each domain is also classified according to the needs it addresses on the side of the consumers and producers of the innovations . Our results show that this perspective may help to identify points of intervention to move toward achieving a systemic reaction to such crises . This paper is structured as follows . Section 2 substantiates our theoretical underpinning by connecting crisis - driven innovations with the notion of fundamental human needs and a perspective on innovation systems . Section 3 presents our data and methodology , including our topic modeling process , the regressions to estimate time trends , and the classification scheme to map fundamental human needs to our sample of innovations . Section 4 presents a synthesis of the derived clusters of our topic model , describing the time trends as well as human needs addressed by various domains of innovations . Section 5 discusses our findings against the backdrop of the unfolding crisis and dedicated innovation systems . Section 6 offers some concrete practical implications of our results . Finally , Section 7 concludes the study and presents some limitations and promising avenues for future research .",419,236569756_32,2

Direct RT - qPCR Omicron variant of concern ( B.1.1.529 ) detection Whenever a new variant of concern emerges , there is an obvious need for rapid and direct detection of variant positive cases in the population . In most countries , the employed strategy is to sequence all COVID-19 positive patients entering the country along with random sequencing of COVID-19 positive patients in the population for the detection of new variants . Next generation sequencing ( NGS ) retrieves the most data and therefore applies to all variants . While NGS can reveal the appearance of a new variant , once revealed it is costly and time - consuming to keep using sequencing methods for the detection of any previously detected variants . The current infrastructures around the world can not provide rapid NGS analysis in terms of large - scale sampling and produce immediate results . It is for these reasons that current NGS analyses are performed on a significantly smaller sub - group of samples and may result in overlooking variants distribution .

The simulated diffraction pattern associated with this theoretical structure agrees well with the electron diffraction data . [ 162 ] The most important question , of course , is why does hydrogenation favor the metallic ( pseudo-)rutile structure over the insulating monoclinic one . Both the DFT and DFT+U methods predict a range of concentrations over which the pseudo - rutile structure is thermodynamically more stable than the monoclinic one at absolute zero temperature , [ 162 ] corroborating the experiments . From the chemistry point of view , this can be understood by considering that the H .. O bond formation will lead to electron transfer from hydrogen onto oxygen atom , therefore reducing the electronegativity of the latter . As a result , the V .. O bond will become less ionic , meaning that less electrons will be donated by vanadium atom , making V d - level more populated and hence resulting in a more metallic behavior . This schematic argument can be tested rigorously with first - principles calculations , and we found that indeed , the vanadium d - orbital occupancy rises monotonically with hydrogen concentration , up to as much as 0.16 electrons for 100 mol% ( in HVO 2 ) . Since the density of states at the Fermi level comes primarily from V d - electrons , this translates directly to doping the system away from half - filling and from Mott metal - insulator transition , which is what the experiments demonstrate .",281,37554957_87,2

These require increasingly powerful electronic or photonic devices to enable important applications , such as augmented reality , point - to - point medical electronics , and wearable devices . In all these applications , there is a strong need to create or collect data all over space , i.e. , to enable point clouds . A point cloud refers to a set of data points in space , usually in three dimensions , based on which a growing number of important applications have recently been achieved , such as motion detection and facial recognition using commercially available products such as Kinect ( Microsoft Corp. ) 1 and iPhone X ( Apple Corp. ) . Common methods to generate a point cloud or , equivalently , spot arrays in optics use diffractive optical elements ( DOEs ) 2,3 or light detection and ranging ( LIDAR ) 4,5 , on which the two aforementioned commercial products are based . The different depths etched on DOEs can create a phase profile , enabling the diffracted beam to form spot arrays on one side , either the transmission or reflection side , similar to a Lambertian surface 6 . Once the scattered beams are captured by the sensors , the computer program can search the encoded information and determine the morphology of the detected objects . However , this approach leads to several disadvantages , such as fabrication difficulty , the inherent limitation of spots spanning only a 2π space , and fundamental limits on the thickness of these devices ( at least comparable to the wavelength ) , which may seriously hinder various applications . Even though the point cloud generated by LIDAR can cover the full space by scanning the azimuth and elevation , the complex and bulky scanning system obstructs the miniaturization of the point cloud generator , which is critical for light portable devices . Thus , to further improve and commercialize novel technologies based on point clouds , apart from the software , new devices must be developed . These should meet demanding requirements : compatibility for integration into traditional silicon - based semiconductor devices , ultrathin form factors to ensure compactness and miniaturization for future trends in light portable devices , commercially viable fabrication and , most importantly , functionality to generate millions of data points to increase the information capacity in full space .",427,158903122_26,2

We apply a preferential attachment based model to generated topic tuple sequences with power - law distributed usage of each topic tuple [ 32,37,38 ] . In the model , an individual 's activity is randomly chosen from the two actions . One is to explore a new subject and publish a paper with a new topic tuple . The other is to return to a previously studied subject and publish a paper with a topic tuple already used . The probability to explore is defined as ρn −γ in which the term n −γ captures the decreasing trend to explore a new subject as the number of papers increases . Consequently the probability of return , i.e. to reuse an old topic tuple , is 1 − ρn −γ . If one returns , the choice of existing topic tuples is governed by preferential attachment : the probability p i to use a specific topic tuple i is proportional to the tuple i 's current usage , so p i = n i / j n j where n i is the number of times that the tuple i is used . The parameters applied are ρ = 0.4 and γ = 0.1 . Each individual 's time step is controlled by the number of papers published , following distribution P ( n ) ∼ n −1.5 with a cutoff n max = 150 .

An obvious elemental fluctuation occurs within ≈12 nm , which agrees with the SB width observed by STEM - PDF ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . To analyze the atomic distributions in the immediate vicinity around each atom in the SB and SBAZs , a fifth nearest neighbor ( 5NN correlation shell ) distribution analysis was performed on the   experimental APT data and compared to the randomized distribution of the atoms in the bulk . [ 44 ] The investigation is restricted to the inter - atomic distances of the 5NN to enhance the statistics and is displayed in Figure 5 . The bulk is well represented by the random model , however , obvious deviations are observed between the SB / SBAZ and the bulk ( Figure 5a , b ) .

Thus , a more than 2 - fold decrease in the expression of serine - threonine protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 was observed , as well as a decrease in the expression of mRNA of the pseudokinase MLKL . These data may indicate that sorafenib inhibited the activation of TNF - induced necroptosis . In addition , a decrease in the expression of Raf serine - threonine kinase , as well as MAPK1 and MAPK3 kinases , was observed after 48 h of treatment of HepG2 cells with So ( Figure 7B ) , which may also indicate inhibition of the kinase cascade .

The model describes the movement of the charges by drift due to the electric field and diffusion due to the gradient of charge carrier concentration , more details can be found in ref . [ 13 ] . The simulations also account for bimolecular recombination within the active layer , calculated using reduced Langevin law , [ 14 ] as it is commonly seen as the main recombination pathway limiting the performance of high - efficiency OPV devices . [ 15 ] One should also note that the drift - diffusion equations use the steady - state mobilities as an input and do not include any effects of charge carrier dispersion . So the dispersion in photocurrent observed in other reports [ 6b , c ] can not be reproduced by the drift - diffusion simulation . However , these simulations are suitable in our case as this study aims to show that steady - state mobilities are the relevant parameters for OPV devices . In addition , if the drift - diffusion simulation can reproduce the experimental data , then dispersion does not play a significant role .",432,3633739_37,2

648a42a41b9b678478b75fe6,6154085,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,1,"To study the effect of proteasome inhibition on osteoclast differentiation , osteoclast progenitors were differentiated into osteoclasts by culture with M - CSF and RANKL in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib . Proteasome inhibitors suppressed osteoclast differentiation in a dose - dependent manner , as indicated in the reduced number of tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells ( Figure 1A , B ) . MG132 ( ranging from 0 to 150 nM ) and bortezomib ( ranging from 0 to 2 nM ) did not affect cell proliferation or cause apoptosis of osteoclast progenitors ( Figures S1 and S2 ) . M - CSF and RANKL are expressed on osteoblasts and their respective receptors , c - Fms and RANK , are expressed on the surfaces of osteoclasts . RANKL / RANK and M - CSF / c - Fms induce essential osteoclastogenic signalling . To explore the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effect of proteasome inhibitors on osteoclasts differentiation , we first analysed the expression levels of c - Fms and RANK in osteoclast progenitors exposed to proteasome inhibitors . The c - Fms protein level was significantly reduced after MG132 and bortezomib treatment , but that of RANK was not altered ( Figure 1C , D ) . These results suggest that the suppressive effect of proteasome inhibitors on osteoclast differentiation is a result of the downregulation of c - Fms . To definitively determine the mechanism underlying c - Fms downregulation mediated by proteasome inhibitors , it was necessary to define the optimal concentration and time for proteasome inhibitor treatment that resulted in the marked decrease or complete disappearance of c - Fms . In Figure 2A , B showing time - and concentration - dependent c - Fms downregulation by MG132 in osteoclast progenitors , c - Fms protein completely disappeared 4 h after treatment with 10 µM MG132 and was not detected after treatment with 2.5 µM or more concentrations of MG132 for 4 h. Thus , all of the other in vitro experiments were performed with MG132 treatment at a final concentration of 10 µM for 8 h , which showed no significant cytotoxic effects ( Figure S3 ) . In contrast with the MG132 - induced reduction of c - Fms protein , the c - Fms mRNA expression did not change in response to MG132 ( Figure 2C ) . These data indicate that c - Fms downregulation by proteasome inhibition was a result of post - translational regulation . but that of RANK was not altered ( Figure 1C , D ) .

These results clearly indicate that c - Fms degradation by MG132 is mediated by RIPping , and not through the lysosomal degradation pathway . RIPping of c - Fms has been reported to be associated with the MAPKs and PKC signalling pathways [ 7,10 ] . To assess the signalling pathways involved in c - Fms degradation by proteasome inhibitors , we next analysed the activities of MAPKs in response to MG132 . MG132 treatment resulted in the activation of all three MAPKs : ERK , JNK , and p38 ( Figure S4 ) . Using specific inhibitors , we showed that MG132 - induced c - Fms degradation via the RIPping process was suppressed by p38 inactivation , but not by the inactivation of ERK , JNK , PKCα , and PKCδ ( Figures 3C and S5 ) . To analyse the relationship between p38 and TACE activation in the MG132 - induced c - Fms RIPping process , osteoclast progenitors were treated with MG132 in the presence or absence of a specific p38 inhibitor , and the activity of TACE was measured . Inactivation of p38 suppressed MG132 - induced TACE activation ( Figure 3D ) . Together , these results indicate that c - Fms degradation by MG132 is mainly achieved through RIPping by activating p38 - mediated TACE signalling .",878,223553157_33,2

[ 57 ] Reaction ( 2 ) shows electrodeposition of Al on the anode side . The charge - storage mechanism proposed in Reaction ( 1 ) assumes that the only active intercalant species is AlCl 4 − . As follows from X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) measurements , intercalation of AlCl 4 − ions into polypyrene was evident from the appearance of both Al 2p and Cl 2p peaks after electrochemical charging ( Figure S4a , b , Supporting Information ) . Additionally , energydispersive X - ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) analysis of charged polypyrene electrodes revealed the appearance of Al Kα and Cl Kα peaks ( Figure S4c , d , Supporting Information ) . However , taking into account that chloroaluminate ionic liquid contains a mixture of AlCl 4 − , Al 2 Cl 7 − , and free Cl − ions , intercalation of all three ions into polypyrene network during charge is possible . Figure 2 shows the electrochemical performance of electrodes composed of pyrene and polypyrene as cathode materials in aluminum batteries at a high current density ( 200 mA g −1 ) . In the case of polypyrene , the capacity initially decreases , but then remains stable for 300 cycles at ≈70 mAh g −1 , which corresponds to more than half of the theoretical value based on a one - electron redox process at the pyrene unit ( 133 mAh g −1 , see calculations of theoretical capacity in the Supporting Information ) . Galvanostatic chargedischarge curves reveal that the storage capacity corresponds to a relatively high discharge voltage of ≈1.7 V ( Figure 2b ) . It has to be noted that electrochemical performance of polypyrene depends on the acidity of chloroaluminate ionic liquid ( molar ratio of AlCl 3 : [ EMIm]Cl ) . As electrochemical data indicate ( Figure S5 , Supporting Information ) , the optimal molar ratio of AlCl 3 : [ EMIm]Cl is ≈1.3 .

Calculation of relaxation times ( Figure 2c ; S8a ) was done manually by counting frames between trapping / releasing GUVs and complete resolution of FtsZ filaments or rings / protrusions . Filament and ring detection in experiments with non - trapped vesicles ( Figure S9 ) was done by collecting Z - stacks images from different positions selected in a tile image of the whole sample well . Z - stack spacing 2 µm was selected to optimize the vesicle visualization . The same procedure is repeated after the addition of the higher osmolarity fresh buffer to deflate the vesicles . Addition of new buffer involves a vesicle movement that makes difficult to track single vesicle state before and after the osmotic change . Filament and Ring detection was done manually using ImageJ.

For the experimental values we have selected the most reliable [ 44,45 ] reported mobilities based on robust four - point - probe measurements and further validated by Hall effect measurements ( see Table S3 , Supporting Information ) , which was possible for all compounds except BTBT , due to its high contact resistance . For the theoretical mobilities we show values calculated along the highest mobility direction , taking into account both off - diagonal and diagonal energetic disorder ( Experimental Section ) . The data show a good correlation with the experiments , especially considering the large / known / documented sample - to - sample variability characterizing OSCs . Quite expectedly the actual experimental values are lower than predicted , because the calculations disregard extrinsic effects that limit the experimentally achievable mobility values , such as contact resistance limitations , chemical impurities , and structural defects . C8 - BTBT - C8 singles out as having a mobility that is higher than the main trend , actually very close to the theoretical value ; this may be because this molecule is known to have self - assembling , liquid crystalline properties , which facilitate growth of thin films with a very low number of extrinsic defects . [ 46][47][48 ] Also , as mentioned above , our simulations do not take into account the dispersion of phonon frequencies away from the Brillouin zone center , in particular , the effect of the zone boundary phonon that involves a sliding motion of the a molecular pair , this is expected to increase the amount of disorder , hence lowering further the theoretically predicted values as recently reported . [ 31,32,49 ] We can now understand how the effects of the structure on the intermolecular vibrations and thermal disorder are ultimately reflected in the mobility of the materials . Based on the transfer integrals alone , alkylation of DNTT should therefore boost the mobility by a factor of 2.5 : in DNTT the combination of J x has the wrong sign , while it becomes ideally isotropic in alkylated DNTT . [ 15 ] However , the enhancement of thermal disorder by the long - axis sliding "" killer "" mode is so strong that it cancels much of this expected gain ; as a result alkylated DNTT is predicted to have only about 30 % higher mobility than DNTT , which is consistent with experimental observations on single crystals . An analogous compensation is predicted for the other pair of molecules , BTBT and C8 - BTBT - C8 . Following the same line of reasoning , the exceptionally high mobility value of rubrene can be attributed to its small energetic disorder due to its reduced sensitivity to the long - axis sliding motion , which compensates for its unfavorable anisotropic transfer integrals .",524,235624815_97,2

648a441f1b9b678478ba2808,245338204,Advanced Energy Materials,2,"Despite our fundamental need for mastering the interfacial processes in battery technologies , up until now researchers still overwhelmingly rely on an array of data / information to build a posteriori a coherent picture regarding battery interfaces , where the investigative power of each technique is largely hampered by their inherent limitations . From a chemical point of view , the identification of major species has proved difficult and has given rise to many controversies , mainly due to the low thickness of the SEI and its extreme sensitivity to air and/or impurities . Indeed , the majority of SEI studies are based on ex situ characterization protocols involving cell manipulation in an inert atmosphere ( glove box ) , transfer vessels , and specific washing processes , all of which tend to contaminate the sample , thus limiting useful data acquisition . Additionally , most of the laboratory characterization techniques employed , either post mortem or operando , lack the time resolution necessary to study events associated with the charge transfer at the interface , and instead probe the interphase that grows upon reactivity of the electrode with the electrolyte . In contrast , electrochemistry is the technique of choice to quantify charge transfer at interfaces but by itself is chemistry blind when not associated with the use of model electrodes or coupled with complementary physical characterizations . Hence , simultaneously visualizing both electron and ion dynamics still presents a major experimental challenge . From a theoretical point of view , the advent of computational approaches , such as density functional theory ( DFT ) or molecular dynamics ( MD ) , critically widened the scope of possibilities to comprehend phenomena at the atomic or electronic level . However , DFT calculations suffer from the large computing cost associated with the introduction of explicit electrolyte or interphase components , whereas classical MD simulations so far lacked the inclusion of charge transfer . Finally , the dynamics of the solid interphases under external stimuli such as cycling , temperature , etc . over prolonged operational periods is still poorly characterized , hindering our ability to predict battery performance based on our understanding of the interfacial charge transfer or the chemical / physical properties of the solid interphases . To overcome these limitations , the development of a continuum model is indispensable .",392,670842_45,2

Using a Bayesian network algorithm , we first identified highly predictive features followed by ridge regression modeling using these features 25,26 . The SSPG prediction model using all omes achieved a cross - validated R 2 of 0.87 ( final model mean square error ( MSE ) 0.16 ) compared to an R 2 of 0.59 ( MSE 0.55 ) using clinical data only ( Fig . 3f , Table S20 ) .

The relationship between insulin resistance and TGL / HDL ratio has already been described 27 and other measures are emerging [ 28][29][30 ] .

For example , clicking one of the many choices while browsing provides partial order between clicked choice versus other choices . Further , scores do convey ordinal information as well , e.g. score of 4 for paper A and score of 7 for paper B by a reviewer suggests ordering B > A. Similar motivations led Samuelson to propose the Axiom of revealed preference [ 21 ] as the model for rational behavior . In a nutshell , it states that consumers have latent order of all objects , and the revealed preferences through actions / choices are consistent with this order . If indeed all consumers had identical ordering , then learning preference from partial preferences is effectively the question of sorting .",193,251656040_148,2

Expression of STAT3 activators , such as IL-6 and granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) , is significantly elevated in the NAFLD microenvironment . Theoretically , CM prepared from fatty livers should capture these cytokines and mediate STAT3 responses . Indeed , our unbiased ex vivo liver - CM system , inspired by Male 's group [ 41 ] , recaptured a similar CCR5 - KO phenotype described above in primary hepatocytes under the NAFLD microenvironment . Most importantly , we showed that CCR5 modulated hepatic lipid metabolism by regulating STAT3 signal transduction . Interestingly , while the role of STAT3 signaling was described in several liver diseases [ 42 ] , the impact of direct STAT3 down - regulation in primary hepatocytes is still undefined so far . Our results provide a glimpse of the relationship between STAT3 signaling and lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes . Our data also suggest that CCR5 signaling may indirectly regulate STAT3 protein expression and phosphorylation in hepatocytes . A previous report showing that the blockade of CCR5 inhibits the IL-6 - STAT3 pathway via up - regulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 ( SOCS3 ) [ 43 ] is consistent with an indirect role of CCR5 in STAT3 regulation .

648a446f1b9b678478bb831c,73487265,Science of The Total Environment,38,"NUE ( the ratio of N output to N input ) can be directly derived from the N budget as a functional value and allows for comparison between agricultural systems . Based on the national OECD N gross balance records for Austria 's farming system , NUE is estimated ranging between 67 and 77 % for the years 2010 - 2014 ( data extracted from http://stats . oecd.org/ , Feb. 2018 ) . Mogollón et al . ( 2018 ) estimate 67.5 - 70 % for the year 2005 . These estimates do not distinguish between different kinds of land - use . Compared to the national values , regional calculated NUEs appear to be notably high . Regarding manure , again , there are different boundaries of the accounting methods ( as within the EF method , compare to Section 3.3 ) , primarily explaining divergences . The OECD gross balance calculation considers N in manure equal to N in excretion ( gaseous N losses during accumulation , storage , and application are integrated ) while the soil N budget calculation considers N in manure being equal to N entering the soil . Apart from this , OECD utilizes country totals for input quantities , here we are limited to adapt input values according to farming practice recommendations . Uncertainties of the regional established N budgets are mainly linked i ) to the amount of applied manure and its N content , ii ) to assumed BNF rates , and iii ) to fertilization of single fields after high - yield harvests . An Austrian report on N balances on the level of groundwater bodies estimates the overall ( additive ) uncertainty for the established N budgets with ±28 % ( BMLFUW , 2013b ) . That study mainly uses the same N in - and output flows as we do . 4.1.1.1 . Arable farming . Based on the established NUEs , we compare the common land uses in the region . Within the three arable CRs compared , the implementation of soya beans ( CR 2 ) to arable crop rotations leads to the highest NUE . The harvest of soya beans is rich in protein ( leading to high N output ) , and N input via plant - based N 2 -fixation is comparatively low ( i.e. , soya beans compared to sugar beets in CR 1 : crop yield C : N ratios are 9 vs 250 ; N input via BNF or as fertilizer is 111 vs 130 kg N ha −1 yr −1 for soya bean and sugar beet , respectively ) . N input incrementally achieved via BNF is successfully picked up by the plants . In contrast , classic "" fertilization events "" lead to higher losses of N , primarily as nitrate . However , specific local data on BNF is not available and had to be derived from external literature . The BNF rate of soya beans used for the N budgets here ( 111 kg N ha −1 ) is based on the average value of a meta - analysis of 637 data sets according to Salvagiotti et al . ( 2008 ) . In this meta - analysis , for 80 % of these data sets the amount of N fixed was not sufficient to replace N export from the fields . The mean net soil N mining was −40 kg N ha −1 ( this value equals the difference of N fixed in aboveground biomass minus N removed with grains ; the value of our study : −22 kg N ha −1 ) . Other Austrian N balances for the agricultural sector use different values for BNF ( e.g. , 125 kg N ha −1 ( Environment Agency Austria , 1998 ) , or 65 kg N ha −1 ( BMLFUW , 2013b ) ) . Therefore , NUE for the cultivation of soya beans described in literature may differ distinctly but ultimately should tend towards a neutral or negative soil N balance .",679,11797475_28,2

Markets emerge from the performances of a variety of actors at a particular moment in time , they are constantly in the making and never finished . Studies in this cluster are rooted in two main theoretical traditions : actor - network theory and service - dominant logic ( SD - logic ) . A key concept derived from actor - network theory is performativity in market practice . Performativity suggests that markets are continuously enacted and both humans and artifacts ( such as technologies and models ) influence market innovation ( Kjellberg , Azimont , & Reid , 2015;Kjellberg & Olson , 2017 ) . Scholars in this cluster thus explore how both artifacts ( such as technologies and models used by actors ) and calculative agencies ( i.e. , market and non - market actors ) come together to act as a whole . Artifacts and calculative agencies together are involved in the creation of markets - as - networks by framing , negotiating , and finding compromises regarding the nature , value and meaning of innovations ( e.g. , Azimont & Araujo , 2007 , 2010 . A typical context in this cluster is business - to - business ( B2B ) . Here , research has , for example , shown how artifacts employed by retailers and manufacturers such as presentations , data , metrics , definitions , and maps facilitate the creation of markets for beverages ( Azimont & Araujo , 2007 ) . This cluster therefore emphasizes the co - creation of value and markets , as well as the recursive nature of how actors , artifacts and markets interact and influence each other in networks or ( service ) ecosystems ( Vargo et al . , 2015 ) . This cluster has the largest number of purely conceptual contributions , and the empirical studies are mostly qualitative case studies . Regarding terminology , many of the articles take a more constructivist perspective and use ' market emergence ' as a term to signify how markets come into existence , and ' market shaping ' as a way to indicate that markets change through purposive action . Market innovation ( e.g. , Kjellberg et al . , 2015 ) is also used as a term in this cluster .",420,16596402_30,2

In Figure 3 , the ionizing photon emissivity at each α -M * 1450 plane is indicated with solid lines assuming case 1 . The shades show the corresponding photon budget , which indicates that the 2σ confidence range falls at ∼ 1−12 % contribution in either case .

Taking systematic uncertainties due to the choice of the clumping factor ( C ∼ 2−5 , Jiang et al . 2016 ) , the escape fraction , and the minimum magnitude of the QLF into account , we place a stringent upper limit of 20 % ; thus , our result supports the scenario that quasars are likely the minor contributors of the ionizing background at z ∼ 6 .",664,240076239_29,2

Even though the exact mechanism of action of ABX remains unclear , our data suggest that additional intracellular factors are required to achieve the ABX effect , e.g. , by utilizing gene regulatory function and exploiting endogenous molecular chaperones that exert a positive effect on β - Glu [ 19,[23][24][25][26][27]50 ] . This peculiarity of ABX also makes it a potential drug candidate for other LSDs .

Furthermore , the percentage of transcripts with poly(A ) tails of up to 5 nt in   Table 4 . length increased to 80 % ( 48/61 ) for hisR and 53 % ( 17/32 ) for cysT ( Figure 6 ) . For the majority of the transcripts , the poly(A ) tails were at least 1 - 2 nt downstream of the mature CCA termini ( Figure 6 ) . The origin of the single adenine 2 - nt downstream of the CCA determinant ( a 1 in Figure 6 ) in the hisR clones could not be unequivocally determined because of the presence of a chromosomally encoded A at that location ( Figure 6 ) . Interestingly , some of the sequenced transcripts ( 5/61 for hisR and 4/32 for cysT ) had poly(A ) tails added immediately following the CCA determinant , which had not been previously seen in either wild - type ( Figure 6 ) or rph-1 strains ( 3,4 ) . Again , none of the poly(A ) tails added to the CCA determinant were > 5 nt . It should also be noted that although > 50 % of the clones were mature tRNAs in the wild - type control , no mature tRNAs were isolated from the Drnt rph-1 double mutant ( Figure 6 ) . We also sequenced 5S rRNA species derived from wild - type , Drnt and Drnt rph-1 strains ( Figure 7 ) . This stable RNA is generated endonucleolytically by RNase E cleavages of a larger 9S rRNA precursor ( 50 ) , creating a p5S RNA species that contains an extra 3 nt at each end ( 51 ) ( Figure 7 ) . Although the 5 0 maturation process is still unknown , the 3 nt at the 3 0 -end are removed by RNase T ( 16 ) . Fifty percent ( 10/20 clones ) of the transcripts in the wild - type strain had both 5 0 and 3 0 mature ends ( Figure 7 ) . The rest of the clones had an additional 1 - 3 nt at both ends . As expected , all the transcripts derived from the Drnt single mutant ( 22/22 clones ) had immature 3 0 -ends , although 41 % ( 9/22 clones ) had mature 5 0 -ends ( Figure 7 ) . Additionally , all of the transcripts had poly(A ) tails that were 1 - 4 nt in length . While the first three As following C ( A ) may have been encoded , at least 9 % ( 2/22 clones , small a ) of the transcripts had poly(A ) tails that were post - transcriptionally added .

648a2ca31b9b67847842bb05,244651817,Journal of Business Ethics,31,"To measure the ESG integration performance , we use Asset4 ESG ratings . Asset4 uses publicly available and traceable sources such as websites , SEC filings , sustainability reports , media sources , and NGO reports to derive more than 700 non - financial firm - level data points . Every data point is the firm - specific expression of a single ESG - related or sustainable characteristic . These data points are aggregated in several stages into 18 categories that cover general ESG themes within the environmental , social , and corporate governance pillars . Asset4 generates a rating for each category . A rating ranges from 0 to 100 points , with 100 indicating a very strong ESG integration performance relative to other firms . Our study focuses on the ESG integration of the UN PRI signatories in their investment and product development processes since the UN PRI explicitly addresses these business activities . Therefore , our major rating is the product innovation rating ( ENPI ) . The ENPI rating reflects a firm 's efforts toward the research and development of environmentally friendly products or services and it considers the reporting on the implementation of screening criteria in the investment selection process . Moreover , we examine whether UN PRI signatories increase their ESG integration in general , i.e. , in all their business activities , by including a more general rating , which is an equally weighted aggregation of the ratings of the three pillars environment , social , and corporate governance ( henceforth EWR rating ) . 7 We argue that an increase in the more general EWR rating subsequent to signing the UN PRI is a further indication for a serious commitment to the initiative since it suggests a general commitment to sustainability issues . 8 In the following , we use ESG as the general term to indicate specific or aggregated ESG integration activities , and refer to the ENPI and EWR ratings as our specific measures for ESG integration performance . We chose Asset4 as our main ESG rating provider because it best fits our study in terms of coverage , scope , methodology , and output , and thus overcomes limitations of other ESG rating databases . Firstly , and in contrast to other ESG rating providers like MSCI - KLD , Asset4 covers a global sample of firms for a time series starting in 2002 . Thus , Asset4 ESG ratings are available for the whole duration of the UN PRI initiative since its launch in 2006 . Moreover , ratings prior to the signature year are important for our methodological setting . Thus , the access to ESG ratings from 2002 to 2005 are critical for our study . Secondly , in contrast to the MSCI - KLD , FTSE4Good , and Dow Jones rating approaches , the scope of Asset4 ESG ratings is comparatively granular . This granularity in the ratings ensures a high level of transparency by providing both the characteristics and the expressions of these data points for every firm in the Asset4 universe ( Chatterji & Levine , 2006 ) . Finally , the Asset4 methodology guarantees a high level of integrity and comparability of the ratings since every data point is cross - checked by at least one additional analyst and by means of statistical analysis tools . Moreover , there was no critical change in the methodology of the Asset4 ESG ratings for the entire observation period , which makes the output of Asset4 ESG ratings comparable in our long time series of Asset4 ESG ratings . 9 Panel A of Table 2 contains descriptive statistics on the ESG ratings for the UN PRI signatories at the end of the matching year ( t −1 ) , i.e. , the year before the signature year . It becomes apparent that UN PRI signatories have the possibility to improve their ESG integration performance after signing , since the ENPI and the EWR ratings are well below the maximum rating of 100 .",678,233025194_49,3

A comparison of the absorption spectrum of a neat solution of astraphloxin ( with constant l M ) with those of its mixtures with different CNT micelles revealed the emergence of new absorption features of the mixtures in the range of 550 - 600 nm ( Figure 6a ) . A new explicit peak at 576 nm appeared in the absorption spectra of the mixtures with CNTs dispersed with SDOC and STDOC , whereas the spectra of the mixtures with CNTs dispersed with SDBS and SDS exhibited a shoulder in that range . The peak at 576 nm is attributed to the longer shift ( up to 36 nm ) in absorption that occurs when the dye interacts with CNTs covered with deoxycholate surfactants ( SDOC and STDOC ) . As a result , the absorption peaks of the astraphloxin monomers and astraphloxin - CNT complexes do not overlap in the case of deoxycholate - treated CNTs . This longer shift can be explained in terms of a better arrangement of the astraphloxin molecules in the J - like aggregation because of the influence of the p - electron systems in the SDOC and STDOC surfactants . For excitation in the range of the new absorption peak ( 550 - 600 nm ) , we observed enhancement of the PL from the CNT levels ( E * 11 in Figure 4b ) for all mixtures containing anionic surfactants ( Supplementary Figure S9 , Supplementary Table S3 ) . The excitation maximum for the PL amplification varied from l EX 5 555 nm for SDBS to l EX 5 565 nm for SDS and to l EX 5 570 nm for SDOC and STDOC . CNTs with the ( 7,5 ) chirality displayed the maximum PL amplification for all anionic surfactants . In the histogram presented in Figure 6b , we summarize the data for the PL enhancement of ( 7,5 ) CNTs , including the reduction of the PL intensity for CNTs dispersed with neutral surfactants due to the bundling process mentioned above . The maximum PL enhancement was observed for mixtures of astraphloxin with CNTs dispersed with SDBS ( see Supplementary Tables S1 - S3 for more data ) . Thus , this study demonstrated the different effects of the dyes on CNTs of each chirality , revealing selectivity in the sensing of CNTs of various diameters . The effect is similar to the selectivity observed when sorting CNTs using SDOC and STDOC 43 . Additionally , we observed a striking selectivity in PL amplification among CNT - dispersing surfactants .",458,232036490_20,3

For cells cultured on the control substrate , the stiffness recorded for healthy cells was reduced by~15 - 20 % and 20 - 25 % , compared to IPF - and NSIP - derived fibroblasts , respectively . The observed trend in cell stiffness was in accordance with those reported before - healthy fibroblasts are softer than disordered cells [ 89,91,92 ] , which may indicate an impairment of disordered fibroblasts induced by the fibrosis process . This result also fits with the fluorescence visualization of the actin cytoskeleton architecture , where large numbers of stress fibers and their characteristic arrangement into parallel fibers which modulate cellular stiffness [ 93 ] , was observed for NSIP - and IPF - derived fibroblasts cultured on glass ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . In contrast , for cells cultured on PDMS D , the determined Young moduli were slightly higher for healthy cells , as compared to their disordered counterparts .

648a42871b9b678478a0eb41,236209948,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,12,"A transporter can potentially mediate substrate uptake and release , and its stoichiometry is a critical factor that controls the driving force and thus the transmitter flux direction . Thus , in principle , D - serine may also be released from astrocytes by reverse transport . To date , ' alanine , serine , cysteine transporter 2 ( ASCT2 ) has been the leading candidate for the reverse uptake of D - serine by astrocytes in vitro ; however , current data indicates that this probably does not occur in vivo . In situ ASCT2 is detected on neurons and retinal glia but not in astrocytes or Bergmann glia [ 141,142 ] . In addition , triggering amino acid hetero - exchange through ASCT2 transporters in vivo did not induce significant D - serine release [ 143 ] . Finally , ASCT2 transporters have a much higher affinity for L - glutamine and L - serine and , under physiological conditions , should preferentially release these molecules [ 72,143,144 ] . The contribution of astrocytic ASCT1 to D - serine release in situ is also unclear . Although ASCT1 KO reduced extracellular D - serine , indicating a role in D - serine release , the selective activation of ASCT1 hetero - exchange in acute slices did not elicit detectable release of endogenous D - serine or glycine [ 145 ] . One possible explanation is that ASCT1 reverse uptake is maximal under resting conditions . Glycine , the other co - agonist of NMDARs , can be released from astrocytes via a non - vesicular mechanism such as reverse transport by the glycine transporter GlyT1 ( reviewed by [ 102,[146][147][148 ] . The glial glycine transporter , GlyT1b , has a stoichiometry of 2Na + /Cl -/glycine , which predicts that glycine can be exported or imported , depending on the physiological conditions [ 149,150 ] . Activation of reverse uptake occurs when there is an increase in intracellular glycine or intracellular Na + and following membrane depolarization [ 149][150][151 ] . Thus reverse - uptake could occur in response to local increases in the intracellular Na + concentrations resulting from either the activation of glia AMPA receptors [ 146,149,[152][153][154 ] or enhanced Na + /Ca 2 + -exchanger ( NCX ) activity following a pure Ca 2 + response . The release is also enhanced by lowering extracellular Ca 2 + and K + [ 150 ] . In astrocytes , receptor stimulation and activation of the G q PCR - PLC signalling cascade may also enhance glycine release via GlyT1 [ 155 ] . By estimation , reversed glycine uptake could increase extracellular glycine from a sub - saturating level ( ~100 nM ) to the low micromolar range [ 146 ] . However , the functional significance of reverse transport in vivo is unknown . Some essential biophysical details are needed to clarify the role of reverse transport , e.g. , the quantification of membrane depolarization and ion concentrations in subcellular astrocytic compartments and transmitter diffusibility . The employment of Na + imaging and genetically encoded voltage sensors will provide some illumination in the future .",531,14632062_5,2

Since the identification of an interchromosomal insertion and an inversion in CCM2 [ 8,9 ] suggests that SVs must be considered as a possible cause of familial CCM disease , we wanted to test whether long - read sequencing could accurately detect these variants . Therefore , we reanalyzed a heterozygous 24 kb inversion on chromosome 7 ( Figure 4a ) , which covers the first coding exon of CCM2 [ 8 ] , with long - read sequencing ( Figure 4b ; Table S3 ) . We used crRNAs that were part of our CCM crRNA - panel to facilitate a dual - cut excision approach covering roughly half of the coding region of CCM2 . The crRNA located upstream of CCM2 was within the variant boundaries of the 24 kb inverted region , whereas the downstream crRNA was located in CCM2 intron 3 . The wild - type allele was present in roughly half of all reads . Two different kinds of reads covering the inversion were present . In both cases , mapping orientation flipped after passing one of the inversion breakpoints ( Figure 4b ) . Due to the different types of reads generated by sequencing the inversion allele , we were able to identify both breakpoints of the 24 kb inversion . This variant was discovered previously only using short - read WGS [ 8 ] . As the variant is copy number neutral and the breakpoints lie in non - coding regions , detection via targeted panel sequencing , whole - exome sequencing , or MLPA was impossible .   A dual - cut approach was used to re - sequence a sample with a known heterozygous 24 kb inversion in CCM2 . CrRNAs facilitated sequencing in opposing directions . One binding site was located inside of the inversion ( yellow arrow ) , and the other one was located downstream of the variant ( green arrow ) . Sequencing of the wild - type allele resulted in one type of reads localized between both crRNA cut sides . Two distinct read patterns visualizing the inversion could be observed depending on which crRNA initiated sequencing of the inversion allele ( inversion reads 1 ; inversion reads 2 ) . Read data were inspected in IGV [ 23 ] . The Locus Reference Genomic ( LRG ) transcripts are shown ( b ) .",402,240504172_19,3

This allowed inference of social connections on a large scale and in an objective fashion that was not influenced by social desirability or other reporting biases that may arise in primary data collection .

We also attempt to ascertain the extent to which the new data are able to discriminate between the predictions of the three dipole models we use . These models can perhaps best be described as parameterisations which incorporate certain general theoretical ideas and can be viewed as providing an indication of the uncertainties remaining in the dipole cross - section once the precise structure function data have been accounted for . Unfortunately we shall find that the new data are not quite precise enough to discriminate between the models or to add any significant evidence for saturation beyond that already present in the F 2 data . We do however find that in diffractive photo / electro - production progress is hindered by the lack of a precise enough measurement of the forward slope parameter B which determines the t - dependence of the final state proton . We take this parameter from data and its error translates into an uncertainty on the normalisation of the predicted cross - sections .

This also recalls the concept of creativity invoked by Barrie and Rooney in their reflections in Sect . 3 . Through the comparison of improvement due increases in the available data and systematic uncertainties , we can see how it is possible to identify and measure creative contributions . This comparison process generates an improvement not attributed to an expected increase in data but rather an improvement attributed to the collaborative effort , effectively a quantification of creativity as a process . Many of the ambiguities in understanding creativity are present in this notion of creativity . Creativity is identified through a comparison of improvements in the measurement outcome , between those attributed to increases in data and those attributed to other improvements such as a decrease in the systematic uncertainties from a transformation in the model of the measurement process . This notion also lends itself to considerations of creativity as a product : unexpected improvements to the model of the measurement process . It also permits even very small improvements to be identifiers of creativity , as long as there is a net positive change across a comparison ( all other things being equal ) . 19 This notion runs counter to other previously discussed notions of creativity , as it removes any requirement for a necessary ' level ' of , or threshold for , novelty .",251,234683604_81,2
648a3a111b9b6784788bc603,238723739,Synthese,4,"A dynamic and active understanding of attunement has been developed in the literature on ecological dynamics . Ecological dynamics is an interdisciplinary framework that combines ecological psychology with dynamical systems theory and the complexity sciences ( Araujo et al . , 2009;Button et al . , 2020;Seifert et al . , 2017 ) . Within ecological dynamics , skilled behavior is seen as the emergence of flexible performance solutions resulting from the interplay between a skilled agent and the affordances offered in its environment . In some recent applications of ecological dynamics , the behavioral data of ecological dynamics is complemented by reports on the phenomenology of skilled action ( Seifert et al . , 2014a , b;Seifert et al . , 2017;Rochat et al . , 2019 , see also Araujo et al . , 2005 . The point here is twofold : skilled agents actively structure their coupling with the environment and this relation to the environment is experienced . 3 Our aim in this paper is to introduce the notion of "" metastable attunement "" as a bridging concept to connect ecological dynamics to phenomenology . 4 Both perspectives - the phenomenological and the ecological dynamical - capture something important about skilled agency . Phenomenology is necessary for describing the first - person lived experience of being a skilled agent acting in a meaningful world . 5 2 This ecological conception of attunement is sometimes characterized in terms of "" resonance "" . The tuning of perceptual systems to environmental information is then understood analogously to the workings of a radio : in tuning in to a specific frequency , the radio extracts information from a wealth of background noise ( Gibson , 1979 , p. 249;Raja , 2020 ) . This metaphor leaves a lot to be desired . As Heft has noted : "" a tuning fork resonates , and indeed , can not help doing so ceteris paribus . But an individual selectively engages the environment [ … ] Because knowing processes are marked by an individual selectively engaging the environment , a term with a more intentional connotation may better direct the thinking here . In this respect , attunement would seem to be more suitable . "" ( Heft , 2001 , p. 366 ) . 3 The idea that our experience is our active engagement with the world is a basic commitment of the enactive approach to embodied cognition ( Varela et al . , 1991 ) . 4 This current paper is very much in agreement with a recent proposal to bridge ecological dynamics and skilled intentionality ( Araujo et al . , 2019 ) . Araujo et al . ( 2019 ) make this bridge in the context of sports science . We use insights from ecological dynamics in sports science and phenomenology to apply it to the broad range of situations encountered in everyday life . In the latter part of the paper , we point to applications in design , architecture and art . 5 Interestingly this first - person perspective ( in agreement with the enactive approach ) provides descriptions of skills in everyday life that complement empirical questions that arise within the ecological 1 3",540,231724185_12,2

While organisational processes were based on a utilitarian ethical framing , reflective of a rationalised , distant relationship of senior leadership to the animals , the ' care for ' relationship was formed between the frontline shelter workers and the animals . Indeed , these shelter workers ' embodied actions and feelings demonstrated a concrete human - animal relationship in which animal value was intrinsic ( core aspects for the ' care for ' framing ) .

648a441f1b9b678478ba30c3,237792009,Advanced Energy Materials,41,"As discussed previously , most of the non - energy - related environmental impacts in the life cycle of LIBs are tied to mining and material processing operations . There are various midpoint and endpoint metrics aimed at characterizing depletion of non - renewable resources . We argue that these multipliers fail to capture the nuances of some of the key inputs to battery production , where availability itself may be a secondary or tertiary concern and the more likely outcome is a long - term shift toward more costly and energy - intensive extraction methods . Rather than attempting to quantify resource depletion in a single metric , we recommend that future LCAs develop a set of current average , marginal , and incremental scenarios for the recovery and processing of a few key material inputs ( including Li , for example ) and use these scenarios to illustrate the longterm implications of continuing to extract these materials without recovering and recycling them at the battery end - of - life . The other impact most relevant to raw material extraction we have discussed here is eutrophication potential . We hesitate to recommend that this metric be included in future studies , in part because the required data on relevant waste stream discharges may not be of sufficient quality to draw meaningful conclusions from the results . Ozone depletion potential , which we briefly touch on , is not likely to be a useful metric to quantify given the ongoing phase - out of ozone - depleting substances such as CFC-11 . [ 88 ] Human toxicity does not feature prominently in non - energy - related impacts within the studies we surveyed , but as noted earlier , published values regularly rely on data provided by large mining companies [ 86 ] and those datasets likely reflect best industry practices and fail to account for the impact of outliers , particularly in artisanal and small mining operations .

648a42871b9b6784789f25f4,232380542,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,9,"As mentioned above , MTDH could not directly bind to the RKIP promoter region . Instead , it might require other transcription factors to regulate RKIP gene . According to our recent work using weighted gene co - expression network analysis ( WGCNA ) , RKIP transcripts were functionally associated with the transcription factor VEZF1 . In particular , their expression is inversely correlated with each other [ 17 ] , which is a similar pattern to the RKIP and MTDH association shown above ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Thus , MTDH - dependent transcriptional inhibition of the RKIP gene could require the functional connection with VEZF1 . To test this possible mechanism , we first examined the binding ability of VEZF1 to the RKIP promoter region using ChIP assay . As expected , the VEZF1 protein bound to the RKIP promoter ( Figure 5A ) , and the overexpression of VEZF1 strongly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the RKIP gene in the luciferase reporter assay . The activity of the −83/+168 RKIP promoter construct ( last bar in Figure 4D ) was very similar to the transcriptional activity exhibited in cells overexpressing MTDH . These data suggest that the transcription factor VEZF1 and MTDH could form a DNA - binding complex and subsequently repress RKIP gene expression in cancer cells . We further examined how the two proteins MTDH and VEZF1 influence the transcriptional activation of RKIP gene using quantitative PCR analysis in cells in which the expression of these proteins was perturbed . As expected , knocking down MTDH increased the transcriptional activation of RKIP gene , and overexpressing VEZF1 significantly decreased the RKIP mRNA transcripts ( Figure 5B ) . However , in the case of the double perturbation ( MTDH - knockdown and VEZF1 - overexpression ) , the amount of RKIP transcripts was similar to the value obtained from VEZF1 - overexpressing cells . This result indicates that MTDH - dependent inhibition of RKIP expression is not observed at the high level of VEZF1 protein .",343,245145432_6,2

The Raman spectra in Figure 3a confirm the surface restructuring of LiMnBPO to a K-/Li - birnessite δ - MnO 2 related phase ( Figure S45 , Note S1 , Supporting Information ) . [ 21 ] The PXRD and SAED data ( Figures S35 and S40d , Supporting Information ) reveal the absence of a structural periodicity capable to lead to X - ray or electron diffraction . Therefore , the newly formed phase can best be described as an amorphous phase containing a birnessite - like short - range order ( called a - δ - MnO 2 in the following text ) . The birnessite structure comprises of MnO 2 layers accompanied by randomly distributed charge - neutralizing cations at the interlayer . Due to these cations , some of the Mn sites are reduced from Mn IV to Mn III . [ 22 ] It has been shown previously that the transformation of Mn - based ( pre)catalysts to active catalysts can follow various ( metastable ) intermediate steps .

Between 200 and 700 cm −1 , several ν 5 , ν 4 , ν 3 , ν 2 , and ν 1 at 407 , 477 , 510 , 578 , and 637 cm −1 , respectively ( Figure 3b ) , were observed within a minute , which became more pronounced with increased time intervals ( up to 24 h ) . The ν 2 band observed at 578 cm −1 is attributed to the in - plane MnO stretching modes along the octahedral layers in a - δ - MnO 2 , while the bands at 510 ( ν 3 ) and 637 cm −1 ( ν 1 ) are associated with out - of - plane MnO vibrations perpendicular to the layers . [ 9a,9b ] Notably , the ν 1 band is red - shifted ( 653 cm −1 ) from its positions in Mn IV a - δ - MnO 2 and matched perfectly with K - birnessite with a mixed Mn III / IV valence state . [ 21 ] The observed ν 3 and ν 4 bands are only present in intercalated Mn III / IV birnessites . The ν 5 band appears as a doublet peak for pure Mn IV phases and not as a singlet peak , as observed in here . [ 9a,21 ] The successive insertion of K was also indicated by the increase in ν 2 /ν 1 ratio , which is in line with the EDX and ICP - AES results . [ 21 ] The vibration at 948 cm −1 can be assigned to the symmetric stretching of PO 4 units , which decreases over time due to the successive loss of P with the growth of the active a - δ - MnO 2 layer ( Figure S46 , Supporting Information ) . [ 24 ] Hence , the Raman spectra show the presence of mixed - valence Mn III / IV K-/Li - intercalated a - δ - MnO 2 on the surface of LiMnBPO during OER . This behavior stands in contrast to the one of electrochemically synthesized birnessite , where in situ Raman studies revealed the complete oxidation from Mn III / IV at open circuit potential to Mn IV under OER conditions . [ 25 ] This demonstrates that the in situ transformation of LiMnBPO is indeed a successful strategy to form a K - containing a - δ - MnO 2 phase with abundant Mn III even under highly anodic potentials to efficiently catalyze water oxidation .",752,233659565_132,3

Park et al . reported similar observations for PS - PI diblock copolymers dissolved in diethyl phthalate ( a selective solvent for the polystyrene block ) during at hermally induced transition from aB CC/ HCP phase to ahexagonal lyotropic phase . [ 57 ] These findings suggest that the spherical micelles fuse to form cylinders along the BCC h111i direction during the BCC - to - hexagonal cylinder phase transition . [ 65 ] If this is correct , then the mean distance between columns of spheres that fuse along the h111i directions should be equivalent to the inter - cylinder distance . Thevalue calculated for the BCC phase just prior to the phase transition ( 22.0 nm ) agrees rather well with the inter - cylinder distance of 22.2 nm determined after the transition . The observed transformation of spheres into worms during the PISA synthesis is favored because of the crystallographic relationship between BCC and HEX phases . H owever , spheres packed in another ( e.g. H CP ) phase maintain their particle morphology until the BzMA polymerization is complete . A sf ar as we are aware , t his is the first demonstration that such aphase transition can be induced during the synthesis of diblock copolymer chains .

The green spheres and cylinders represent the PBzMA cores of nanoobjects that form structured arrangements within acontinuousphase comprising PhBD 80 chains and n - dodecane . diblock copolymers did not form such highly ordered structures . [ 88][89][90 ] Conclusion Time - resolved SAXS has been used to monitor the evolution in copolymer morphology that occurs during the PISA synthesis of PhBD 80 -PBzMA 40 diblock copolymer worms at 90 8 8Ci nn - dodecane when targeting 40 % w /w solids . Asthe structure - directing PBzMA block grows during this PISA synthesis , t here is ag radual evolution from molecularly dissolved copolymer chains to spheres to closepacked spheres ( BCC / HCP phases ) to afinal mixture of HEX and HCP phases ( where HEX denotes hexagonally packed cylinders - or partially aligned worms - and is the major phase ) . SAXS analysis suggests that this HEX phase is generated via sphere - sphere fusion within the BCC phase . T o the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that any longrange order has been observed for block copolymer nanoobjects during their PISA synthesis . Itisemphasized that this is achieved using an amorphous core - forming block , rather than a(liquid ) crystalline block . [ 49 ] Serial dilution of the HEX/ HCP phase leads to the formation of ad isordered phase comprising mainly non - interacting worms at 1.0 % w /w . Thermal annealing of the as - synthesized 40 % w /w PhBD 80 -PBzMA 40 dispersion induces acylinder - to - sphere transition at 150 8 8Ct op roduce ad isordered sphere phase . O nc ooling to 25 8 8C , the spheres form an HCP lattice , j ust like the minor phase that co - existed with the HEX phase during PISA . The observation of al amellar phase for the near - symmetric PhBD 80 -PBzMA 40 diblock copolymer in the solid state indicates that selective swelling of the PhBD 80 block by ndodecane results in myriad ordered morphologies that are generated during the BzMA polymerization and/or upon thermal annealing . F inally , t he basic principles of block copolymer self - assembly suggest that our observations should also apply to other PISA formulations .

Because Varuna 's body is assumed to have an ellipsoidal shape ( e.g. , Jewitt & Sheppard 2002;Lellouch et al . 2002 ) , data from each light curve were fitted to a Fourier series m = Σ i [ a i sin(2iπφ ) + b i cos(2iπφ ) ] , where m is the theoretical value of the relative magnitude obtained from the fit , φ is the rotational phase ( calculated as the fractional part of ( JD − JD 0 ) /P , where JD is the Julian Date , JD 0 = 2451957.0 is the initial Julian Date , and P is the rotation period in days ) , and ( a i , b i ) are the coefficients of the Fourier function ( with i = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ) . In our specific case , we used up to secondorder ( i = 2 ) or up to fourth - order ( i = 4 ) Fourier functions . The second order is the minimum order that allows a double - peaked fit ; however , higher orders take into account small deviations on inhomogeneous objects and can be used to fit light curves that are highly sampled . The 2001The , 2002A , 2011The , 2018 and 2019 light curves were fitted to a fourth - order function , while the remaining light curves were fitted to a second - order Fourier function , because the number of data points in those runs was not large enough to use a higher order .

Addition of retinol to the culture further increased Socs3 expression to approximately 20 fold ; in contrast , addition of the RAR antagonist significantly reduced the Socs3 mRNA expression ( Fig . 3d ) .

648a398e1b9b678478886cb2,204814249,Advanced Materials,1,"Perovskite Solar Cells just a few years of research , lead halide perovskite solar cells have reached certified efficiencies of 25.2 % , thereby already exceeding other well - established thin film solar cell technologies , such as CIGS or CdTe in small devices ( < 1 cm 2 ) . [ 1,2 ] Considering their nearly ideal optoelectronic properties for a solar cell semiconductor , that is , a high absorption coefficient , long carrier diffusion lengths , and highly luminescent nature , it is expected that perovskites will reach or even surpass the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of monolithic silicon solar cells ( 26.7 % ) . [ 3,4 ] Moreover , their comparatively wide bandgap and simple fabrication ( from solution or evaporation ) render them ideal candidates for applications in silicon - based tandem devices , where the perovskite solar cell is attached as add - on to , for example , industrially fabricated passivated emitter rear contact ( PERC ) or heterojunction with an intrinsic thin layer ( HIT ) silicon cells . [ 5][6][7 ] Today , silicon / perovskite tandem solar cells have the largest potential for a rapid industrial realization in the near future and silicon / perovskite tandem solar cells with 28.0 % PCE have already been demonstrated . [ 8 ] Importantly , tandem solar cells are not bound to the thermodynamic limitations of single - junction cells and efficiencies beyond 35 % [ 9 ] have been predicted for two - and four - terminal silicon / perovskite tandem cells . In order to unlock these potential PCEs for single - junction and tandem perovskite solar cells , it is essential to gain a more detailed understanding of the underlying recombination loss processes . It is well established that nonradiative recombination losses are the primary reason that perovskite solar cells have not yet achieved their full thermodynamic potential . [ 10,11 ] Nonradiative recombination losses limit not only the cells ' open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) but also the fill factor through an ideality factor larger than one . [ 10,12 ] The source of nonradiative recombination loses in perovskite cells remains a heavily debated topic . Historically , the main focus was reducing trap - assisted recombination at defects in the perovskite bulk or at grain boundaries . [ 10,13,14 ] Indeed , considerable improvements were achieved through advanced perovskite fabrication schemes to increase the grain size , enhance crystallinity , and the invention of multication and/or multihalide formulations . More recently , an increasing number of publications have been dedicated to addressing the issue of recombination at the perovskite surfaces [ 15][16][17][18 ] which differs from the bulk in terms of chemical composition and morphology . [ 14,16,19 ] For example , Beard and co - workers studied the charge carrier dynamics in single crystals and polycrystalline thin layers of methylammonium lead iodide / bromide ( MAPbI 3 /MAPbBr 3 ) using transient reflectance spectroscopy ( TRS ) . [ 20,21 ] In contrast to the often employed transient absorption spectroscopy ( TAS ) , this technique is very sensitive to the photoinduced carrier concentration in the surface - near region of the semiconductor . Experiments were performed with different excitation energies , thereby varying the penetration depth of the incident light . These investigations showed that surface recombination is more important than recombination within the crystalline grains and at internal grain boundaries . A detailed analysis of the data revealed a surface recombination velocity of less than 10 3 cm s −1 , orders of magnitude smaller than the recombination velocity of nonpassivated surfaces of traditional semiconductors which are of the order of 10 5 cm s −1 and above . Interestingly , the MAPI polycrystalline thin layer exhibited longer carrier lifetimes than the corresponding single crystal samples , which was attributed to unintentional trap passivation during thin film preparation . These findings put a strong emphasis on the understanding of the nature of surface traps and the suppression of surface recombination . This is particularly important when considering that advanced perovskites , which comprise multiple anions and/or anions of different chemical nature , are becoming increasingly used throughout the community . Molecular modifiers ( e.g. , tri - n - octylphosphine oxide , TOPO ) are often applied to passivate the surface traps . As shown in Figure 1 , Braly et al . [ 22 ] recently demonstrated that even the most simple methlyammonium lead iodide ( MAPI ) perovskite absorber ( with a bandgap of 1.6 eV ) can show an external photo luminescence quantum yield ( PLQY ) of ≈20 % , which would in principle allow a high open - circuit voltage of ≈1.28 V after passivating the top surface with TOPO . This value is very close to the absolute thermodynamic limit of 1.32 V , demonstrating that bulk defects are at least in this case of little importance . Moreover , high external PLQYs were also obtained in other perovskite absorbers ( e.g. , 66 % by Abdi - Jalebi et al . [ 23 ] ) .",864,36049331_36,3

Furthermore , although ESCs expressing the full complement of miRNAs provide the most physiological reference point for the function of the miR-290 - 295 cluster miRNAs in normal , unstressed cells , the effect of these miRNAs in these cells is confounded by the effects of other co - expressed miRNAs . Similarly , if the profiled cell population was heterogeneous with respect to the pluripotency / differentiation status , the let-7 miRNAs may have masked the effect of miR-294 , because these miRNAs have antagonistic effects ( 19 ) .",255,10666475_45,2

The setup is similar to , except that we added three scenarios where 25 % , 50 % and 75 % of training labels are scrambled . Table 5 shows the comparison between L2NNNs and ordinary networks . Dropout rate and weightdecay weight are tuned for each WD / DR run , and each WD+DR+ES run uses the combined hyperparameters from its row . In early - stopping runs , 5000 training images are withheld as validation set and training stops when loss on validation set stops decreasing . The L2NNNs do not use weight decay , dropout or early stopping . L2NNNs achieve the best accuracy in all three partially - scrambled   To illustrate why L2NNNs generalize better than ordinary networks from noisy data , we show in Table 6 trade - off points between accuracy and confidence gap on the 50%-scrambled training set . These trade - off points are achieved by changing hyperparameters ω in ( 3 ) and v in ( 5 ) . In a noisy training set , there exist data points that are close to each other yet have different labels . For a pair of such points , if an L2NNN is to classify both points correctly , the two confidence gaps must be small . Therefore , in order to achieve large average confidence gap , an L2NNN must misclassify some of the training data . In Table 6 , as we adjust the loss function to favor larger average gap , the L2NNNs are forced to make more and more mistakes on the training set . The results suggest that loss is minimized when an L2NNN misclassifies some of the scrambled labels while fitting the 50 % original labels with large gaps , and parameter training discovers this trade - off automatically . Hence we see in Table 6 increasing accuracies and gaps on the test set . The above is a trade - off between memorization ( training - set accuracy ) and generalization ( training - set average gap ) , and we hypothesize that L2NNN 's trade - off between nominal accuracy and robustness , reported in Section 3.1 , is due to the same mechanism . To be fair , dropout and early stopping are also able to sacrifice accuracy on a noisy training set , however they do so through different mechanisms that tend to be brittle , and Table 5 suggests that L2NNN 's mechanism is superior . More discussions and the trade - off tables for 25 % and 75 % scenarios are in the appendix .",458,233029680_51,2

In many ways , the essence of a mega - event is scale .

Indeed , securing and delivering a mega - event speaks to the power of the host city 's elite ( Liao and Pitts , 2006 ) . As Müller 's framework demonstrates , the criteria that define a mega - event predominantly involve macro - scale interests . Reflecting this , evaluation data and impact assessments generally use aggregate monitoring data at city , regional or national levels eliding uneven development and differential community - level experiences ( Kasimati , 2003;Preuss , 2004;Owen 2005 ) .

When the mitochondrial membranes isolated from these mutant yeast strains were analysed by BN - PAGE followed by SDS - PAGE and immunodecoration , a sub - complex of about 100 kDa was identified containing cytochrome c 1 bound to core protein 2 ( Figure 5a ) . This quite unexpected finding was also confirmed in a mutant yeast strain in which the gene encoding the core protein 1 had been deleted [ 8 ] . On the contrary , in another yeast mutant strain in which the gene encoding the core protein 2 had been deleted , the appearance of a new sub - complex of about 78 kDa and made up of cytochrome c 1 bound to core protein 1 was found ( Figure 5b ) [ 8 ] . Altogether , these data demonstrate the capability of these three proteins , cytochrome c 1 , core protein 1 and core protein 2 , to interact each other , thus increasing their stability in the absence of an assembled form of the bc 1 complex . Independent experiments , carried out in a yeast mutant strain in which the genes encoding both core proteins had been deleted ( ∆cor1/∆cor2 ) and in which Cor2 - TAP was overexpressed , revealed the association of cytochrome c 1 with Cor2 - TAP [ 54 ] . This finding reinforced the previous results and suggested early and preferential binding of this catalytic subunit to the core protein 2 when the bc 1 complex assembly is blocked at the level of the early core . The interaction between cytochrome c 1 and the core proteins in an unassembled bc 1 complex is quite unexpected , but it is possible that the N - terminal pre - sequence of this catalytic subunit interacts with the core proteins during the import into mitochondria . In fact , the two core proteins are relatives of the α and β subunits of the MAS - encoded matrix processing peptidase present inside mitochondria [ 74 ] . However , differently from plants , the yeast core proteins do not show any protease activity . It is also noteworthy to observe that in the crystal structure of the mature bc 1 complex , cytochrome c 1 is in the vicinity of core protein 1 but not of core protein 2 ( Figure 5b vs. Figure 5a ) . However , the structural organization of the proteins can be different during the process of assembly of a multi - subunit complex in comparison to the mature form acquired after insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane .",472,155092778_5,2
648a60bc1b9b678478777635,10151339,Nucleic Acids Research,24,"The requirement of NF - Y for repression of p53 family members is inferred from several findings . ( i ) The elimination of the CCAAT boxes leads to the abrogation of the negative effect of DNA - damaging agents , or p53 / p73 / p63 overexpression , on promoter function . ( ii ) In vivo ChIP experiments from our lab established that p53 is associated to G 2 /M promoters in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts , and it is activated through acetylation upon DNA - damage . Moreover , several control experiments strictly linked the presence of p53 to NF - Y bound promoters [ ( 20 ) and references therein ] . This picture is mirrored for p63 in the cells used here , HaCaT and primary keratinocytes , as representative of a tissue ( skin ) affected by p63 mutations in AEC patients and in knock - out mice . HaCaT cells harbour two DNA - binding mutant alleles of p53 . In these cells , the DNp63a is by far the most abundant , if not the sole isoform present [ ( 31 ) and Figure 1 ) . Our ChIP data identify DNp63a associated to cell - cycle regulatory genes and confirm that p53 is also bound ; importantly , this is observed both in immortalized and primary keratinocytes , indicating that this is not an epiphenomenon of immortalization . The PLK promoter , harbouring only one CCAAT , is devoid of DNp63 ( and p53 ) . Thus , CCAAT promoters are targeted not only by p53 , but also by p63 ; the presence of multiple CCAAT boxes is important for p63 association . It is possible that p73 , in the proper cellular context , behaves similarly , as evidenced by ChIP studies on the PDGF - b - R ( 43 ) . In none of these promoters are there recognizable p53 / p63 - binding sequences , and the most obvious hypothesis is that recruitment is obtained through direct protein - protein interactions with NF - Y. Indeed , endogenous NF - Y and p63 do interact ( Figure 4A ) . On the NF - Y side , the aC of the H2A - like NF - YC is required , a stretch clearly different from H2A , centered on the crucial , highly conserved Phenylalanine 111 ; a mutation of this residue abolishes binding to p63 , as well as to NF - YA ( 37 ) . The model resulting from the NF - YB - NF - YC crystal structure ( 37 ) suggests that multiple NF - Ys might predispose a peculiar , highly bent DNA structure for p63 association . This could reflect the tetrameric status of p63 , needing multiple NF - Y docking sites to associate , therefore being limited to promoters , and cellular conditions , in which multiple CCAAT boxes are bound .",494,242291039_15,2

Indeed , as Barde ( 2003 , p. 161 ) noted regarding epidemiological advances of the 19th century , discoveries of the causes of disease have '' changed only the language of the scapegoating , not the target . '' While many scholars agree on the role of the media in disseminating knowledge and risk discourses , the media 's effect on risk perceptions is much debated . Sensationalistic media coverage does not necessarily create heightened anxiety of being infected ( Bergeron & Sanchez , 2005;Joffe & Haarhoff , 2002 ) . Audiences may instead respond to the messages of reassurance ( Ungar , 1998 ) and locate the risk of infection among those othered by news coverage ( Joffe & Haarhoff , 2002 ) . Stigmatized populations may reject being labeled as at - risk by not complying with public health measures that would confirm their inferiority ( Nations & Monte , 1996 ) , while sanitary citizens may position themselves outside the defined risk category to create a sense of protection ( Briggs , 2004;Joffe , 1999 ) . Finally , variability exists within any group around how individuals respond to risk discourses ( Joffe , 1999 ) . This paper considers how risk discourses are produced and the responses of stigmatized populations in places without infection . I investigate the historical and political - economic dimensions shaping explanations of risk and blame during SARS , and the ways in which these ideas contributed to the production of local epidemic narratives in Chinatown , New York City .",373,255967705_14,2

For example , our control experiments prove that an appropriate silver layer is helpful for obtaining a high - quality colour hologram ( Supplementary section 9 ) . In addition , higher efficiency and less crosstalk can be achieved by utilising higher order peaks with thicker dielectric layers and suitable wavelengths ( Fig . S2e ) . The demonstrated 3D - integration concept is also extendable for achieving more complicated functions . For example , one can choose more types of colour filters to generate a fullcolour transmission image and smaller unit size to store more data because our algorithm can flexibly design the metasurface based on the distribution and size of the colour filters .

One needs to attribute the most delay time to t bo , which is consistent with the requirement of a significant ∆t jet . Meng et al . ( 2018 ) showed that the thermal radiation from a structured jet can account for the observed GRB spectrum . Within this scenario , one has to explain why ∆t jet is significantly longer than the dynamical time scale of the central engine ( ∼ millisecond ) . One possibility is to argue that this time scale is the the time scale of the hyper - massive NS , and the jet launching happened after the collapse of the NS . This hypermassive NS phase seems to be favored to interpret the kilonova data ( Margalit & Metzger 2017 ) . On the other hand , there is no obvious reason why a relativistic jet can not be launched during the hypermassive NS phase . Another issue of this interpretation is that the observed duration of the short GRB is much longer than δt R , which defines the typical duration of a shock breakout GRB through the angular spreading time scale .

However , establishing whether informal caregiving had a causal effect on mental health is challenging given potential endogeneity issues , including self - selection into caregiving ( Bom et al . , 2019 ) . To account for selection into caregiving , recent papers used different matching techniques . Bom and Stockel ( 2021 ) and Stockel and Bom ( 2021 ) employ propensity score matching to explore the health effects of informal caregiving using data from the UK and the Netherlands . They find negative mental health effects of caregiving , especially among caregivers who provide care for longer , and with higher intensity as measured by additional hours of caregiving . De Zwart et al . ( 2017 ) also employ matching to deal with selection issues when studying health outcomes of spousal informal caregivers . Analysing data from the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe ( SHARE ) , they found that caregiving has a negative short - term effect on informal carers ' overall health .

Given 1 - nm bins within which LP emission is stable , this range provides more than 400 unique colors , with room for further expansion using different materials ( e.g. , InGaAsP and InAlGaAs for NIR - I and NIR - II , InGaN for visible ) . The use of the NIR range also preserves compatibility with conventional fluorescent probes in the visible wavelengths that can label different cellular features ( e.g. , nuclei , membrane ) . The availability of hundreds of spectrally distinct colors for multiplexed imaging enables longitudinal cell tracking even in dense , scattering tissues . In our study 25 , we used microdisk LPs to track thousands of individual cancer cells over several days in a 3D tumor spheroid invasion model . Our data enabled the classification of individual cells according to their motility and the identification of cells moving together in small packs within the spheroid by analyzing spatial correlations in velocities . Despite progress in the development of multiplexed imaging probes , the number of resolvable colors , or available barcodes , is still far fewer than desired for most applications ( ~10,000 cells per 1 mm 3 of tissue volume ) . To tag cells uniquely , the number of barcodes should exceed the number of cells . Spectral barcoding with LPs is a practical and scalable approach to break through this limitation . LPs with different emissions can be combined to readily achieve millions of unique barcodes ( Fig . 2b ) . One approach is the uptake of multiple LPs in each cell ( Fig . 2c ) , as long as LPs can be colocalized to specific cells by segmentation of cell boundaries . However , this approach would not be suitable for dividing cells since barcode fidelity would be lost upon LP segregation . A more tractable approach is using multiple LPs stacked together in a single particle to generate an emission composed of multiple laser lines 25 ( Fig . 2d ) . To associate spatial information with single - cell analyses , the emission spectra of LP tagged cells can be read during imaging to catalog the position and identity of cells within tissue and following tissue dissociation at an appropriate step before subsequent analyses ( Fig . 2e ) . For plate - based sequencing , LP emission can be measured during or after the sorting of single cells into individual microwells . LP cell tagging is also compatible with high - throughput methods , including microdroplet - based 26 and split - pool barcoding 27 , which introduce cell - specific DNA barcodes for highly parallel analysis as long as an association between the optical LP barcode and the DNA barcode is made .",510,255746304_13,2

648a42951b9b678478a94672,67858936,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,13,"Information about germline mutation in FPC is essential for developing surveillance and treatment strategies , and there have been several studies along these lines ( Table 2 ) . According to a germline mutation analysis of four genes ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 and CDKN2A ) in 727 affected cases including 521 FPC , the percentage of cases harboring the above gene mutations was higher in FPC probands than in non - FPC probands ( 8.0 % vs. 3.5 % ) ( odds ratio : 2.4 , 95 % CI : 1.1 - 5.4 ) [ 63 ] . In this study , the mutation prevalence in the FPC cohort was 3.7 % for BRCA2 , 2.5 % for CDKN2A , 1.2 % for BRCA1 , and 0.6 % for PALB2 . Grant et al . conducted targeted sequencing of 13 genes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes or FPC for 290 PC probands , and showed the mutation prevalence was 2.6 % ( 95 % CI : 0 - 6.0 ) in cases with a history of PC in FDR and 4.0 % ( 95 % CI : 2.1 - 5.9 ) in those without any history [ 64 ] . Petersen et al . also conducted germline analysis of 25 cancer susceptibility genes for 303 PC patients including an FPC cohort in the Mayo Clinic Familial Pancreatic Cancer Registry , and reported that 12.9 % of 186 FPC cases and 9.4 % of 117 non - FPC cases harbored some mutations [ 65 ] . From a Japanese cohort of 1,197 PC patients , Takai et al . identified 88 ( 7.3 % ) FPC cases , and conducted germline sequencing of hereditary cancer susceptibility genes [ 66 ] . In this study , deleterious mutations were detected in 8 of 54 ( 14.5 % ) cases , including 3 ( 5.6 % ) BRCA2 mutation , 2 ( 3.7 % ) PALB2 mutation , 2 ( 3.7 % ) ATM mutation and 1 ( 1.9 % ) MLH1 mutation . These data indicate genomic heterogeneity in FPC , although inconsistencies in mutation prevalence among studies might be influenced by the number of target genes , limited sample size or subjects ' backgrounds , including ethnicity . Importantly , previous studies found no susceptibility gene mutations in more than 80 % of FPC cases , suggesting that further investigations to identify novel susceptibility genes should be fruitful . Germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes are also found in cases without definite family history or association with hereditary syndromes . Hu et al . conducted germline analysis of 22 cancer susceptibility genes for 96 PC cases without preselection based on family history , and detected deleterious mutations in 13.5 % of the cases , including 9.4 % for four genes ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , and MSH6 ) [ 67 ] . Yurgelun et al . conducted targeted sequencing of 24 hereditary cancer susceptibility genes in a series of 289 resected PC , and detected mutations in 9.7 % of the cases including 7.3 % for HRR genes and 1.0 % for MMR genes [ 68 ] . Targeted sequencing of 32 genes in an unselected PC series of 854 cases revealed deleterious mutations in 3.9 % of the cases , including 3.5 % for 7 FPC - related genes [ 69 ] . Hu et al . recently compared genomic data of 3,030 affected cases and a normal cohort , and found that 5.5 % of the affected cases harbored mutation in 6 genes associated with increased PC risk ( CDKN2A , TP53 , MLH1 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and ATM ) [ 70 ] . In the latest germline analysis of 298 unselected PC patients , 23 ( 7.7 % ) patients harbored deleterious mutations in PC susceptibility genes [ 71 ] . In this study , 6 of 23 ( 26.1 % ) mutated cases actually did not fulfill prescribed genetic testing criteria for hereditary cancer syndrome or FPC , and 12 of the 23 ( 52.2 % ) mutated cases would not have been checked according to the criteria . These results indicate that the disparity in germline mutation prevalence between FPC and sporadic PC is not dramatic , and that current screening strategies chiefly based on family history can not completely extract susceptibility gene carriers . On the other hand , exhaustive genomic analysis seems not to be cost - effective , since mutation is not so frequent . Here , software risk assessment tools based on family and past history of PC , such as PancPRO , might deserve further consideration [ 72 ] .",785,13402197_4,2

Thus , biosensors could revolutionize the analysis of complex samples in healthcare , medicine , and the life sciences . [ 41 ] Various approaches , including methods based on nanowires , surface plasmon resonance , and microcantilevers , have shown promising results in this regard . [ 42,43 ] The research groups of Whitesides [ 44 ] and Niemeyer [ 45 ] independently described fabrication routes towards affordable , disposable biosensor platforms . Lieber and co - workers demonstrated the use of nanowire - based field - effect transistors for the electrical detection of distinct disease - marker proteins in clinically relevant serum samples . This approach could eventually facilitate pattern analysis of existing and emerging biomarkers for diagnosis . [ 41,46 ] Matrices with immobilized morphogenic proteins are usually used in tissue engineering as a structural support for cells in bone , [ 47,48 ] skin , [ 49,50 ] articular cartilage , [ 51 ] and vascular tissue , [ 52 ] and are also used in neural - stem - cell expansion . [ 53 ] Iwata and co - workers developed enhanced cell - culture substrates for the selective growth of neural stem cells ( NSCs ) that displayed artificial dimers of epidermal growth factor , a strong activator of NSC proliferation . With their approach , they could significantly enhance cell - growth rates relative to those observed in usual methods . [ 54 ] Radisic and co - workers successfully assembled endothelial cells in a three - dimensional collagen scaffold by functionalizing it with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and thus demonstrated that vascularization in large three - dimensional tissue constructs , which would be required to ensure oxygen supply , might be possible with immobilized VEGF . [ 55 ] Despite the large number of successful examples of the application of protein biochips in biomedical and biotechnological research , numerous challenges remain to be tackled . Most protein biochips are currently prepared by traditional strategies , which lead to random protein orientation on the chip surface . This random arrangement can negatively influence protein activity or ligand binding as a result of steric hindrance , and can thus lead to a decrease in assay efficiency or even the falsification of assay results . [ 34 ] The problem might be solved by the implementation of moreadvanced methods for the preparation of protein biochips . Many such methods have been developed over the last few years . [ 4 ] The expression and purification of thousands of proteins with retention of their intrinsic activity is far from trivial . [ 34 ] However , a growing number of approaches for the fast production of high - quality proteome - scale protein biochips are being developed for several organisms . One example is the "" full - length expression - ready gene collection "" ( FLEXgene ) , which consists of complete - ORF plasmid collections from various species for the simple cloning and expression of whole proteomes . [ 56 ] The introduction of label - free detection methods , such as mass spectrometry or surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) , will simplify microarray analysis , since interaction partners no longer need to be labeled . This feature is particularly important for large - scale analysis based on protein biochips . Evans - Nguyen et al . incubated a superhydrophobic , selfassembled - monolayer - modified , porous gold surface displaying immobilized antibodies with plasma spiked with an antigen peptide , and after matrix application detected bound peptides directly by using MALDI . [ 57 ] Campbell and Kim reviewed the promising application of SPR for the label - free readout of protein - protein interactions on protein microarrays .

648a441f1b9b678478ba1a73,103419711,Advanced Energy Materials,92,"Another important effect on the dark high - frequency capacitance is that of applied voltage , which critically depends on the bias range and device charge density . At reverse bias , the capacitance often saturates toward C g , as illustrated in Figure 16 , meaning full depletion of the space charge zone . However , care must be taken when interpreting the capacitance in the Mott - Schottky plot representation at forward bias because at least two different capacitances compete below and around V bi . Like in the experimental data in Figure 16a , some devices actually present a nearly constant charge density profile ρ(x ) = qN eff ( negative , if N eff ≈ N A ) , x being the distance from the junction . Hence , the Mott - Schottky analysis is meaningful and the fitting of the linear region of low forward bias gives N eff and V bi . However , in most cases , the quasi - intrinsic character of the perovskite and variable doping by vacancy displacement prevents the use of this technique , which is the situation of Figure 16b . For such samples , the fitting of the nearly linear region around equilibrium ( Figure 16b dashed red line ) would deliver a meaningless V bi value , and the fitting of the apparently linear abrupt step around the expected V bi ( Figure 16b , solid red line ) is that the transition to a dominant exponential capacitance that appears as flat - band potential is approached and exceeded ( see Figure 16 , right axes ) . Consequently , Mott - Schottky analysis is not useful here . Actually , for some devices , the shape of the charge density can be approximated to a power law ρ(x ) = qηx γ ( η is a constant with units of cm −(γ +3 ) and γ is an integer ) . Thus , by integrating the Poisson equation ( analogously to Section S1.1 in the Supporting Information ) along a depletion layer of width w , it is easy to obtain after some calculations [ 97,106 ] ( ) dl ( 2 ) bi",369,255216969_6,2

There were 52 complaints of certification violations in the RSPO system ( EIA 2015 ) thus pushing the conflict outside the RSPO ( harnessing value conflict through deliberation , Table 4 ) . Furthermore , the RSPO has overall consulted a heterogeneous , yet limited group of stakeholders to better understand the debated issues and develop appropriate assessment tools . Participation and influence was limited to those sources that were considered as technical and objective ( harnessing knowledge uncertainty through deliberation , Table 5 ) . For example , given the knowledge uncertainty and value conflicts between the proponent of GHG emissions targets and palm oil producers , the RSPO commissioned a first working group ( WG1 ) in 2008 to review all stages of the palm oil supply chain and create support for voluntary actions to reduce emissions .

Thus , the perspective of stakeholders providing a sociocultural value to the land was ignored at a monitoring level ( Johnson 2014 ) decision - making could be reached , another working group ( WG2 ) was established in 2009 , comprising both members of the Executive Board as well as 20 non - RSPO members , with representation from each of the RSPO 's constituting groups .

The identification and characterization of such variations is of high importance in current genomic research , as it has been shown that many of them play a significant role in various disorders such as cancer ( 3 ) . Currently , there are several possible ways to identify and discover SVs in the genome using different types of genomic data ( 4 ) . First , read - depth or depth - of - coverage can be used to infer the relative copy number of genomic regions when compared with a reference sample . Second , the relative mapped position of readpair members , known as paired - end mapping , can be used to find deletions , tandem duplications , inversions and intra - chromosomal signatures . Finally , reads that span a DNA breakpoint in the sample appear as split reads when mapped to the reference genome . Several variant callers based on read - depth , pair - end or their combination already exist and are extensively reviewed by Alkan and colleagues ( 5 ) .

However , as has been suggested , relevant temperatures and pressures for different systems can vary widely . For example , conditions for post - combustion capture , where the major separation is between CO 2 and N 2 , are signifi cantly different from that for pre - combustion capture , where CO 2 is to be separated out from H 2 or CH 4 . Indeed even among post - combustion capture systems at different power stations there can be subtle differences , such as the CO 2 concentration in fl ue gas from a gasfi red station to that from a coal - fi red station as discussed earlier . These issues coupled with the advanced synthesis methods to rapidly generate a variety of cation exchanged species ( e.g. , K + and Na + ) of many different zeolites mean that a large quantity of gas adsorption isotherm data need to be collected for a comprehensive analysis on one single type of materials . [ 25 ] Therefore a signifi ca nt bottle - neck for CO 2 adsorption studies using new zeolite - based adsorbent materials is the availability of access to effi cient gas adsorption instrumentation . As a result instrument manufacturers are attempting to develop automated high throughput gas adsorption analyzing units . One notable example of which is a volumetric technique that can analyze 28 samples in parallel recently developed by Wildcat Discovery Technology Inc. [ 28 ] This apparatus has recently been demonstrated in a high throughput study of cation exchanged forms of zeolites Na - A ( LTA ) and Na - X ( FAU ) for use in CCS , with the results acquired from the high throughput analyzer validated against data acquired from a conventional Micromeritics ASAP 2020 gas adsorption analyzer . [ 29 ] Zeolites have already been widely used in many industrial processes . However , their application in CO 2 capture from power plant fl ue gas has not been as successful . This is likely because zeolites can be deactivated by moisture , leading to a signifi ca nt reduction in CO 2 adsorption capacity . One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that water can reduce the strength of the local electric fi eld on the cation sites . [ 30 ] Since water is an inevitable product from combustion , cation exchanged zeolites are considered to be ineffective unless the moisture content is removed prior to CO 2 adsorption , or prevented from entering the zeolite by some other means . There are , for example , several reported attempts at forming a waterproof coating for zeolites , which have had a highly hydrophobic surface layer chemically bound to the zeolite crystallites in a post - synthetic process .

It is possible to significantly reduce the spread of infectious diseases by pre - emptively disseminating knowledge about how widely infectious diseases are spreading and how severe the outbreaks will be and educating the public on precautionary measures ( Funk et al . , 2009;Wang et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , to effectively respond to the spread of infectious diseases , it is important for people to recognize the general symptoms of infection , so that they may determine whether or not they are infected by comparing their own symptoms with those of people around them , and then take appropriate measures accordingly ( Zang , 2018 ) . In the past , people mostly relied on mass media and word of mouth to obtain information about an infectious disease and how to prevent it and respond to it ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . However , with the availability of the internet and the widespread use of search engines , people began to seek information more actively , and this effort is reflected in the data of their search activity . There have been many studies of behavioral analysis or forecasting using RSV in various fields , not only regarding infectious diseases , and in many such studies , RSV was understood through the lens of the human behavior processes described in theories such as the five stages of the consumer buying process or the innovation adoption model ( Kotler et al . , 2014;Rogers , 2003 ) . According to these theories , problem awareness leads to information searching and the seeking of alternatives for problem solving ( Jun et al . , 2014 ) . In the same vein , RSV regarding infectious diseases has been found to be useful for quantifying the level of people 's awareness of infectious diseases ( Boehm et al . , 2019 ) . Through specific keyword analysis , it is possible to distinguish , for example , whether people want to know "" what "" infectious disease is spreading is and "" what "" kinds of symptoms indicate infection , or whether are seeking information on "" how "" to prevent and treat it ( Cairo , 2020 ) . Because Google has a dominant share ( 92 % ) of the global search engine market ( Statcounter , 2020 ) , the RSV of Google searches has been recognized to be an especially effective means of gauging people 's perception of infectious diseases ( Do et al . , 2015;Hu et al . , 2020 ) .",459,252843568_196,2

The measurements were performed in the total electron yield mode , with the magnetic field being aligned antiparallel to the incoming X - ray beam and forming an angle θ with the surface normal of the sample . Special care had been taken in order to center the beam by rechecking the sample position and signal every multiple of 10 ° . At θ = 80 ° , the projected beam spot width on the surface is 2.8 mm , being still considerably smaller than the sample width of 4 mm .

Accordingly , no significant beam damage could be observed in the spectra throughout the measurements . For magnetization curves no data points were collected within B = ±0.2 T at a magnetic field sweep rate of 2 T min −1 due to polarization reversal of the coil current , which also implied a waiting interval of around 20 s at zero field .

The relationship between Hsp90 and Bcl6 occurs at multiple levels and has implications for understanding the biology of normal germinal center B - cells and DLBCL pathogenesis . Approximately 70 % of DLBCLs are Bcl6 positive , yet only about half of these cases contain translocations or point mutations that could drive constitutive Bcl6 expression14 . Yet DLBCLs lacking these genetic lesions can still be biologically dependent on this oncogene17,18,21 . The physical and functional interaction of Hsp90 and Bcl6 may at least in part explain this phenomenon , by virtue of directly stabilizing both the Bcl6 mRNA and protein . Although the proportional contribution of Hsp90 to Bcl6 mRNA versus Bcl6 protein stability can not be precisely asserted , our data indicates that both effects contribute to maintain Bcl6 levels . Upregulation of Bcl6 is required for normal B - cells to form germinal centers , within which B - cells undergo affinity maturation . The fact that Hsp90 localizes to the nucleus of normal centroblasts raises the possibility it could contribute to B - cell differentiation by allowing Bcl6 to accumulate in germinal center B - cells .

This results in crystallization depths that strongly depend on the temperature gradient in the PCM layer , which can only accurately be determined using self - consistent multiphysics simulations . In a first approximation for this complicated multiphysics problem , we performed simulations where we varied the crystallization depth of the C - spots by approximating them as elliptical cylinders with a height d ( corresponding to the crystallization depth ) smaller than the whole GST - film thickness t ( Figure 3a ) .

Zhang and coauthors [ 33 ] show statistical convergence ( see also [ 6 ] ) , but the analysis restricts the algorithm to at most one pass over the data , which is in general not enough for the training error to converge . Current work explores the benefits of more frequent averaging of the parallel sequences [ 4,32 ] , but thus far the question of how often communication rounds need to be initiated has eluded a concise theoretical answer . Indeed , the lack in the theoretical understanding of local SGD is astounding : the literature does not even resolve the question whether averaging helps , i.e. concretely , whether running local SGD on K workers is K times better than running just a single instance of SGD on one worker . 1 We fill this gap in the literature and provide a concise convergence analysis of local SGD . We show that averaging helps , i.e. by frequently synchronizing K local sequences , the convergence rate increases by a factor of K , i.e. a linear speed - up can be attained .

In agreement with our structure of the A730 loop , the reversal of the four Watson - Crick base pairs within this domain ( U753 - G732 , G754 - C731 , C758 - G729 and A759 - U728 ) did not significantly affect cleavage activity , but mutations of loop residues had more important effects ( 16 ) . Although all base substitutions at G757 ( G9 ) and A730 ( A20 ) led to reduced activity , replacing the G9 - A20 combination by a G - C , a G - U or an A - A was less detrimental than other substitutions ( 16,18 ) . Thus , these mutational data indicate the importance of a purine at position 757 and of cis - WC/ WC base pairing ( 75 ) between residues 757 and 730 . This is in agreement with the role of the G9 - A20 base pair in stabilizing the S - turn motif . Mutation of A756 ( A8 ) by U , C or G caused the largest reduction in cleavage activity [ $ 400 - 800 - fold ; ( 16,18 ) ] , which is consistent with its proposed mechanistic role as a general acid ( 21,23,25 ) . Functional group modifications of A756 revealed that the Watson - Crick edge of A756 is particularly important for cleavage ( 17 ) . In the structure of SLVI , the Watson - Crick edge of A8 is exposed in the minor groove and accessible for docking with the cleavage site internal loop and performing its catalytic role .",294,235401332_16,2

The strength of the negative ET depends nonlinearly on the average power . For 190 W and above , the strength of the negative ET is underestimated because the calculated HOM integral decreases due to a strong back transfer from the HOM into the FM , which manifests itself as dips in the HOM content . The reason for this phenomenon is that the phase shift between the RIG and the MIP becomes larger than π at various locations along the fiber , which corresponds to a positive phase shift that enables an energy coupling from the HOM to the FM . Additionally , we have investigated the evolution of the strength of the maximum negative ET , i.e. , the HOM content at the time at which the strongest negative ET occurs , as a function of the average power , which is represented by the blue dots in Fig . 6b . The maximum possible energy coupling , which corresponds to a full ET from the FM into the HOMs , is reached at~150 W average output power , where the curve saturates . Derived from coupled - mode theory and according to ref . 33 , the maximum coupling strength , which is denoted as Κ max , for transmission gratings is expressed as where κ is the coupling coefficient and L is the length of the grating . This behavior should also be observable for the RIG in our fiber , even though it is non - uniform over the whole fiber length due to the anisotropy that is induced by the power extraction under counter - pumping conditions . However , it is possible to define an equivalent uniform RIG that will result in the same maximum possible energy coupling 33 .

The fit of the experimental data to the intra - particle diffusion model Eq . ( 6 ) provides an insight into the overall rate of sorption ( Table 2 ) .

A SRH bulk lifetime of about τn + τp = 750 ns best describes the experimental TPL data of coevaporated bulk passivated with TOPO in the glass / perovskite / TOPO stack ( grey ) . This SRH bulk lifetime would allow much higher opencircuit voltages than 1.05 V.

The simulations suggest that for the coevaporated cell , these additional recombination losses are caused by misaligned energy levels and increased recombination at both interfaces ( see Figure 6 ) . Interface recombination at the PTAA / MAPI interface ( coevaporated sample ) leads to slightly shorter decay times TPL , HLI  at small Fermi - level splitting ( green ) as opposed to the samples without charge - extracting layers attached ( grey ) .

The proposal here is that the established correlation between benzo[a]pyrene and cancer in experimental animals may be carried over to humans by means of extrapolation . An influential suggestion is the mechanism - based approach to extrapolation : ' the mechanisms approach to extrapolation suggests that knowledge of mechanisms and factors capable of interfering with them can provide a basis for extrapolation ' ( Steel 2008 , p. 85 ) . According to this approach , a claim about an experimental animal model may be extrapolated to humans only if there is some knowledge that the mechanisms which support the causal relation of interest in the animal models are sufficiently similar to those in humans , where the mechanisms are sufficiently similar only if there are no differences in the mechanisms that would result in a difference in the outcome of interest produced by the mechanisms . Notice that this means that the requirements for mechanistic similarity are more stringent the more specific the outcome that is being extrapolated ( Steel 2008 , pp . 93 , 94 ) . In other words , extrapolating a precise quantitative claim about the extent to which an exposure increases the risk of cancer requires closer mechanistic similarity than extrapolating the qualitative claim that the exposure is a cancer hazard . Leuridan and Weber ( 2011 , p. 97 ) claim that ' it is clear that the IARC procedures do take into account the role that information about mechanisms can play in extrapolating results from animal experiments to humans ' . Indeed , this claim seems to be supported by the explanation of the role of mechanistic data that is provided by IARC :",305,233073128_99,2

Because our time is limited , as is our funding , we constantly have to make decisions as to which instruments ( telescopes , microscopes , etc . ) to construct , which expeditions to undertake , which experiments to run , and so on . Such decisions will be informed by which hypotheses we deem most promising . Had we deemed hypothesis H promising , and had we wanted to compare that with the hypothesis currently dominant in our field , we might have run a different set of experiments than we actually did , given that in fact we deemed H more promising than H and were mainly interested in comparing H with the received doctrine . Which hypothesis or hypotheses we deem most promising , and most worthy of spending our limited resources on , will at least in part depend on how probable they appear to us , compared to their most direct rivals . If ( say ) a Bayesian update makes H more probable than H , while the opposite will be the case if we update via some non - Bayesian update rule , then our decision to use one of these rules may put us on a very different research path with very different downstream consequences than if we had decided to use the other rule .

The expected pragmatic argument for Bayes ' Rule applies just as well when the options between which you 'll choose after updating are whether to pursue one hypothesis or another , or whether to conduct this experiment or that one , and when the utilities that attach to those hypotheses at the different possible worlds are given by the accuracy of the credence functions you 'll end up with if you do pursue that intellectual trajectory .",522,56175300_13,2

We also calculate the results with the filled version of WSO maps , in which the missing data are filled by interpolation from adjacent CRs . Figures from the WSO results showing the same information as that of Figures 2 and 3 are presented in the support material . It can be seen that although the WSO results tend to give larger fraction of coronal hole area in the mid - latitude , the main findings from the GONG results , including the evolution of coronal hole distributions , the dominance of low / mid / high latitude coronal holes in footpoints of the near - ecliptic field lines , and the evolution of the HCS structures , are still valid . Figure 4 presents the time series of the daily mean solar wind speed and the wavelet power spectrum of the solar wind speed . During minimum 22/23 , the solar wind exhibits periodicity of solar rotation ( 27 days ) at the very beginning and the second half of the study interval . During minimum 23/24 , relatively structured fast solar wind streams persist through 2008 , with most of their maximum speed above 600 km / s. Periodicities at both solar rotation ( 27 days ) and its subharmonic periods ( 13.5 , 9 days ) are observed for continuously long patches with high spectral intensities . The periodicity at solar rotation indicates that the fast streams recur in each rotation , implying that the low - latitude coronal holes generating these streams persist for many rotations in this interval . The subharmonic periods implying two or three major low - latitude coronal hole regions are longitudinally separated , resulting in a pattern of two - three peaks in the speed profiles ( Luhmann et al . 2009;Tulasi Ram et al . 2010;Li & Feng 2018 ) . In 2009 , the solar wind speed starts to decay and the strong periodicities disappear . This change may be explained by what can be observed from Figure 2 ( b ) and ( e ) . The distributions of the low - and mid - latitude coronal holes are fickle in 2009 , and the low - latitude coronal holes gradually diminish . For the recent solar minimum 24/25 , strong fast solar wind streams with maximum speed higher than 600 km / s are observed between yr 2019.5 and 2019.9 , when the band of isolated low - latitude coronal hole in Figure 2 ( c ) is seen . Significant periodicity at solar rotation is continuously observable during the occurrence of the fast streams , being similar to what has been seen in 2008 . However , the subharmonic solar rotational periodicity is not evident , implying there may be only one major fast stream in each rotation . Between 2020.0 and 2020.5 , as the solar corona evolves into the dipolar state , the slow solar wind becomes dominant , and no periodicity pattern can be seen in the wavelet spectrum . A similar situation can be found in minimum 22/23 around the mid of 1996 . In the second half of 2020 , the fast streams are observed again , with apparent one - rotation periodicity and observable half - rotation periodicity , indicating that a two - peak structure recurs in each rotation . Figure 5 compares the distributions and averages of solar wind parameters in the three minima . The shapes of the distributions of speed for minima 22 and 24 look similar , but the occurrence of high - speed solar wind above 500 km / s in minimum 24/25 is the lowest among the three minima . The distribution of minimum 23/24 is characterized by the high - speed tail above 600 km / s , but such high - speed tail is absent in minima 22/23 and 24/25 . As can be seen in Figure 4 ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) , the 27 - day average speed represented by the green line fluctuates around 400 km / s in minima 22/23 and 24/25 . In contrast , it decreases gradually from about 500 km / s to about 350 km / s in minimum 23/24 , following the decaying of the low - latitude coronal hole seen in Figure 2(e ) . The average solar wind speed of minimum 24/25 is lower than that of the two previous minima , and even lower than that of minima 20/21 and 21/22 ( Jian et al . 2011 ) . The average IMF strength during minimum 24/25 is weaker than that of minimum 22/23 , but stronger than that of minimum 23/24 . The strengthen of IMF from minimum 23/24 to 24/25 ends the trend of IMF weakening from minimum 21/22 to 23/24 ( Jian et al . 2011 ) , and may also be in connection with the increase of the solar polar field .

This review explores common practices in lithium - ion battery LCAs and makes recommendations for how future studies can be more interpretable , representative , and impactful . First , LCAs should focus analyses of resource depletion on long - term trends toward more energy and resourceintensive material extraction and processing rather than treating known reserves as a fixed quantity being depleted . Second , future studies should account for extraction and processing operations that deviate from industry best - practices and may be responsible for an outsized share of sectorwide impacts , such as artisanal cobalt mining . Third , LCAs should explore at least 2 - 3 battery manufacturing facility scales to capture size - and throughput - dependent impacts such as dry room conditioning and solvent recovery . Finally , future LCAs must transition away from kg of battery mass as a functional unit and instead make use of kWh of storage capacity and kWh of lifetime energy throughput .",347,255441206_123,2

The presence of pesticide active substances on potential food items highlights the need for quantitative risk assessment as part of the authorisation process , but the complexity of undertaking this assessment where direct and substantive exposure can be expected is widely acknowledged . The risk from dietary exposure is assessed within regulatory procedures by combining information on toxicity of the respective compound and estimates for levels of exposure that wild birds may be subject to via seed treatments ( European Food Safety Authority , 2010 ) . Lower tiers of assessment will normally indicate potential risk for seed treatments , so ' higher tier ' assessment , such as the use of radio - tracking data and focal species dietary data , is required to estimate the level of exposure in farmland bird species more accurately ( European Food Safety Authority , 2006 ) . Product application instructions also play an important part in safeguarding wildlife from pesticide use . With regards to NN seed treatments specifically , product labels state that seeds should be buried at a minimum depth of 4 cm , and that no seed should be left on the soil surface after drilling ( Bayer Crop Science UK , 2019 ) . Nevertheless , it is recognised that absolute compliance with this requirement is impossible to achieve ( European Food Safety Authority , 2010 ) . The availability of seed on the soil surface is known to be a function of crop type , season of sowing , soil condition , sowing equipment , and location within the field ; for example , in the Netherlands , average surface seed densities were greatest for winter wheat with standard sowing equipment ( 20 and 31 seeds / m 2 measured in successive seasons ) and on average there was 3.5 times more seed present on the soil surface at the headlands compared to the field centre ( de Snoo and Luttik , 2004 ) .",381,71715926_21,2

Conventional cable - based transmission approaches can not meet the enormous data transmission requirements . With the advantages of low loss , large bandwidth , and anti - electromagnetic interference , optical fibres have replaced cables and have been widely used as the transmission medium in fibre to the home ( FTTH ) networks , metropolitan area networks ( MANs ) , backbone networks , and transoceanic communications 3,4 . Due to the wide application of fibre - optic networks , optical fibres exist anywhere in modern society , and the fibre can be exploited for more functions than data transmission . In addition to acting as the transmission medium in fibreoptic networks , optical fibre can also act as the sensing medium in optical fibre sensors [ 5][6][7 ] . Among the numerous optical fibre sensors , distributed optical fibre sensing ( DOFS ) interrogates a large number of points in a single sensing fibre , thus providing an overwhelming advantage over conventional node - type sensors in longdistance measurement [ 6][7][8 ] . In particular , DOFS techniques functionalities for fibre - optic network 25,33,34,[38][39][40][41 ] . Initially , Φ - OTDR only utilized dedicated or idle undersea fibre cables as the sensing medium to detect seismic waves 20,33,34 . In recent years , Φ - OTDR has been integrated into coherent optical communication networks by wavelength - division multiplexing ( WDM ) and frequencydivision multiplexing ( FDM ) to enable both data transmission and distributed vibration detection [ 38][39][40][41 ] . With these integrations , traffic monitoring and road roughness detection have already been explored in the existing fibreoptic networks . It is foreseeable that more potential functions such as urban structure imaging , safety monitoring of the city gas pipeline , and ocean detection are also likely to be developed . However , the demonstrated schemes just share fibres in DOFS and fibre - optic networks , and there are still two individual systems . Due to reserving channels for DOFS ( fibre or spectrum resources ) , the current solutions reduce the transmission efficiency . For integrated schemes using individual spectrum channels in communication and DOFS , the transmission performance may be degraded as the strong probe used in DOFS easily excites non - linear effects . Moreover , coherent optical communication is commonly used for long range transmission and seems poorly match to conventional DOFS ( which works efficiently in tens of kilometres ) . Since data transmission is the primary function of fibre - optic networks , an efficient integrated solution should maintain or even improve the transmission performance . Theoretically , it is possible to improve the transmission performance by suppressing or utilizing the non - linear effects 42 . Therefore , the current solutions might not be good choices for implementing integrated sensing and communication in optical fibres , especially for the short / middle range application scenarios .",544,4010071_1,2

The other crystals demonstrate deviations of different extent in their PSDs from constant levels in the low frequency region ( Figure S5.2 , Supporting Information ) . We need to stress that the longer the correlation times probed , the smaller the number of data points become . This results in a large statistical uncertainty of the estimated PSD in the low frequency region . To understand if the observed deviations from constant levels have any significance , one needs to compare them with the statistical deviations in the PSDs of TLSs where spectrum must be constant at low frequency . For this purpose , we generated intensity traces of TLSs using Monte Carlo simulations with the same bin time , trace length , and characteristic time as in our experiments and then calculated their PSDs using the same algorithm as for the experimental data ( Figure 2 and Notes S6 and S7 , Supporting Information ) . We found that PSDs of TLSs , similarly to the experimentally observed PSDs for our crystals , also often show some "" wavy saturation "" shape in the low frequency range instead of a constant . However , these deviations are as large as expected from the confidence intervals calculated by our algorithm ( Figure 2c , d ) . Thus , considering the error bars , we can classify most of the recorded PSDs ( 75 % ) as possessing saturation and hence exhibiting well - defined maximum fluctuation correlation times in the range from 0.5 to 10 s ( Note S7 , Supporting Information ) . Thus , only 25 % of the studied crystals possess even slower fluctuation dynamics with times in the range of 100 s or longer ( Figure 2e , f ) .",331,236881672_13,2

648a446f1b9b678478bb4862,45215519,Science of The Total Environment,2,"In comparison to the estimation of the cointegrating relationships , some studies have explored the causal relationships between economic growth , energy consumption , and CO 2 emissions through a multivariate framework using the Granger - causality time series or panel data approaches . The results of the empirical findings are , however , inconsistent . The existing literature addressing the casual relationships mainly falls into three categories . The first category of studies found evidences supporting unidirectional or bidirectional causality . Taking India as an example , Ghosh and Kanjilal ( 2014 ) demonstrated a unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to economic activity . Al - mulali et al . ( 2013 ) found that while 60 % of Latin American and Caribbean countries maintained a positive bidirectional long - run relationship between energy consumption , CO 2 emissions , and economic growth , the remaining 40 % yield mixed results . Using error - correction - based Granger causality models , Acaravci and Ozturk ( 2010 ) found a one - way causal relationship to exist between economic growth and energy consumption . The same result was arrived at by Jalil and Mahmud ( 2009 ) in their study of China . Results of the study taken by Pao and Tsai ( 2010 ) indicated bidirectional strong causality between energy consumption - emissions , and bidirectional long - run causality between energy consumption - output , along with unidirectional causalities between emissions - output and energy consumptionoutput ( both strong and short - run , respectively . ) . Further , Sari and Soytas ( 2009 ) found a long - run relationship between income , energy consumption , and CO 2 emissions in Saudi Arabia , but not in Indonesia , Algeria , Nigeria , and Venezuela . However , Narayan and Popp ( 2012 ) revealed a negative causal relationship to exist between energy consumption and economic growth in the G6 countries . The second category comprises of research that has found no causality existing between the variables . Soytas et al . ( 2009 ) found that income does not maintain a relation of Granger - causality with carbon emissions in the United States in the long run ( although energy use does ) . Soytas and Sari ( 2003 ) did not locate a causal relationship between the variables - energy conservation can , in their analysis , help reduce CO 2 emissions without affecting a country 's economic growth . Apergis et al . ( 2010 ) found that in the short - run renewable energy consumption does not contribute to reductions in emissions . In addition , Hossain ( 2011 ) found that there was no evidence of long - run causal relationship from economic growth to CO 2 emissions and from economic growth to energy consumption for the panel of newly industrialized countries from 1971 to 2007 . The third category studies have found that the direction of causality is methods or periods dependent . For instance , using panel smooth transition regression , Heidari et al . ( 2015 ) found that the casual relationship between economic growth , energy consumption and CO 2 emissions is time instability dependent . CO 2 emissions increased with GDP growth in the first stage ( per capita income below 4686 USD ) while the direction was reversed in the second stage ( per capita income above 4686 USD ) . The study on Malaysia taken by Begum et al . ( 2015 ) showed that over the period of 1970 - 1980 , CO 2 emissions decreased with economic growth ; however from 1980 to 2009 , CO 2 emissions increased sharply with a further increase of GDP . Similar results were also found by Cleveland et al . ( 2000 ) . Taking China as an example , Wang et al . ( 2011 ) demonstrated the existence of short - run and long - run causality running from energy consumption to economic growth using a multivariate causality test . Similar studies were taken in Russia by Zhang ( 2011 ) , in Switzerland by Baranzini et al . ( 2013 ) , and in Turkey by Yalta ( 2011 ) . In addition , Burke et al . ( 2015 ) explored the short - run effects of GDP growth on CO 2 emissions for 189 nations taking 1961 - 2010 into consideration . They found evidence of delayed effects between energy - economy causality dialogs : specifically , emissions tend to growth quicker after booms and slower after recessions . Using a meta - analysis of the existing large literature , Kalimeris et al . ( 2014 ) did not find a genuine causal effect between energy and GDP in the literature as a whole . Similar results were also found by Bruns et al . ( 2014 ) using the same method .",825,58584865_34,2

The absence of anomaly at T N in the electrical transport data is in agreement with the scenario of J eff = 1/2 Mott state . All the pseudospins lie in the ab - plane , and show uniform deviation of ~13 ° from the a - axis . The canting is within the ab - plane , and there is no canting along the c - axis . Various techniques , including neutron scattering and resonant X - ray scattering ( RXS ) , demonstrated that the pseudospin canting rigidly tracks the rotation of IrO 6 octahedra , resulting in the well - known locking relation :  ~  [ 37,39,41 ] . This locking effect between the pseudospin canting and lattice distortion was reproduced theoretically by Jackeli et al . [ 42 ] . Because of the canting , net magnetic moments appear alternatively in each IrO 2 planes , and are coupled antiferromagnetically along the c - axis . In this sense , Sr 2 IrO 4 is fully compensated at the ground state without showing macroscopic magnetization . A magnetic field H larger than the critical value H flop can cause a flop transition , and the net moments of IrO 2 layers are then ferromagnetically aligned along the c - axis , resulting in a weak ferromagnetic ( FM ) phase [ 43,44 ] , as sketched in Fig   Benefiting from recent technological advances in resonant X - ray scattering , direct probing of the Ir pseudospins is allowed , noting that Ir has large neutron absorption ratio , which challenges related characterizations using neutron scattering technique [ 37 ] . Extensive efforts in the last several years revealed that the AFM order is mainly stabilized by the strong nearest - neighbor ( NN ) intralayer AFM interaction of ~ 0.1 eV [ 45][46][47 ] . Regarding the interlayer coupling , it was found to be as small as ~ 1.0 eV , 10 5 times weaker than the intra - plane AFM coupling [ 47 ] . Such a large 10 magnetic anisotropy allows the so - called flop transition , also known as the AFM to weak FM ( AFM - wFM ) transition , as demonstrated with RXS [ 43 ] . The AFM order of Sr 2 IrO 4 looks fairly robust and the AFM fluctuation with long - rang in - plane correlation was found to persist at even ~ 20 K above T N , which can be described by the two - dimensional S = 1/2 quantum Heisenberg model [ 47 ] . Another work addressing on critical behavior of Sr 2 IrO 4 revealed that the critical scattering can be followed out to a much higher temperature ( T N +73 K ) , and XY anisotropy is important for accounting for the pseudospin interactions [ 48 ] . High magnetic field experiments revealed that the AFM order does n't show any trace of breakdown up to H ~ 60 T [ 25 ] . The weak FM phase was found to be quenched at hydrostatic pressure P ~ 20 GPa , which is probably due to the reorientation of pseudospins from the ab - plane to the c - axis rather than the AFM order collapse [ 49 ] .",606,255068141_68,2

Unfortunately , this estimation assumes a 100 % stoichiometric reaction and it is unlikely to happen , particularly for solid , non - porous adsorbents such as CaO , due to the accessibility of sites . Therefore , the experimental data are usually much lower than these values . For amine adsorbents , normally it is assumed that two amine groups will react with one CO 2 molecule to form the more stable carbonate species ( see Figure 1 ) .

On the other hand , the effi ciency of CO 2 adsorption for an adsorbent can be derived from the experimental and theoretical maximum adsorption capacity as follows : Mesoporous silica 1.0 - 2.0 chemisorptions onto basic groups ( e.g. , amines ) 1 - 5 g [ 13 ] Carbons ( CNT , mesoporous carbon ) 0.5 - 3.0 Physisorption ( except amine - functioanlized CNT ) < 1 g [ 13 ] Organic cage framework ( OCFs ) 1.0 - 5.0 Physisorption and chemisorption < 1 g [ 15 ] This value indicates how many basic sites , such as the number of amine groups on an adsorbent , are engaging with CO 2 molecules .",300,235609133_56,2

An alternative route for creating highly hydrophobic exterior surfaces without hampering the material 's internal porosity is the creation of rough surfaces , so - called corrugation , on the nano - to micrometer length scale . In 2014 , Kitagawa and coworkers reported superhydrophobic MOF materials by using external surface corrugation originating from aromatic surface groups . [ 48,69 ] The authors reported a porous coordination polymer with external surface design ( PESD ) , [ Zn 4 ( µ 3 -OH ) 2 ( BTMB ) 2 ( DMF ) 3 ( MeOH ) ] using the organic linker BTMB 3− (= 1,3,5 - tris(3 - carboxyphenyl)benzene ) , which possesses an aromatic hydrocarbon - terminated surface ( Figure 16a ) . The material 's surface area is 295 m 2 g −1 and powder XRD measurements of flake - shaped single crystals of PESD-1 reveal that the ( 010 ) surface is the material 's dominant surface ( Figure 16c ) . Calculations based on single - crystal data confirm a nanometerscale corrugation along this surface with a periodicity of 1.2 × 1.1 nm 2 , caused by the surface termination by the aromatic hydrocarbons of the organic linker . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) characterization suggests that the ( 010 ) surface is relatively flat in larger length scales ( Figure 16b , d ) . To examine the material 's hydrophobic properties , contact angle measurements were performed on as - synthesized and activated powder , single crystals , and pellets , all of which yielded markedly different results ( see discussion in section 3.5 about challenges in characterization ) . The authors additionally performed solvent adsorption at 298 K for water , benzene , cyclohexane , and toluene . In the water adsorption experiments , for hydrophobic materials rather untypical behavior is observed on PESD-1 . Two significant steps at 0.27 and 2.3 kPa are observed on the adsorption isotherm . This indicates that while the exterior surface is repellent toward liquid water , the interior pore space is actually hydrophilic and accessible to water vapor ( like a lotus leaf ) . The adsorption isotherm of hydrophobic organic solvents such as toluene and benzene shows a gate - opening adsorption isotherm , although cyclohexane was not adsorbed . These results indicate that PESD-1 has framework flexibility along with size - selective pores toward guest molecules . The same group recently reported a de novo synthetic method for preparing other MOF with nanosurface corrugation , including PESD-2 and PESD-3 [ Zn 2 M 2 ( µ 3 -OH ) 2 ( BTMB ) 2 ] ( M = Co and Ni ) , with Co 2 + or Ni 2 + occupying the octahedrally coordinated Zn 2 + positions . [ 205 ] It should be noted that the reported bimetallic MOFs exhibit outstanding superhydrophobic behavior even at elevated temperatures . PESD-2(Co ) exhibits a particularly large surface area and good uptake of solvents such as benzene , toluene , and cyclohexane .",527,205572894_2,2

[ 28,29 ] The sensor is equipped with an electronic noise free circuit , and therefore provides high sensitivity and fast readout , which enable us to acquire clear EBSD maps of halide perovskite films on glass quickly before damaging the samples . We used an optimized beam current of 100 pA at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV , with a pixel dwell time of 100 ms . The electron dose needed for acquiring EBSD maps here is 6000 times lower than what was previously neces sary for single crystal samples using the traditional phosphor screen and camera ( 6 nA for 10 s ) . [ 22 ] Backscattered electrons escape from the tilted sample and are projected onto the detector in a pattern of spherical bands that reflect the Bragg angles of the local crystal lattice ( Kikuchi lines ) . [ 30 ] By scanning the beam across the sample , we collected a pattern from each pixel and indexed it to the cubic CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 lattice to con struct a map of the film 's local crystallographic orientations . Figure 1b - e shows EBSD maps of the CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 per ovskite prepared with different spinning times . The grain size becomes larger with reduced spinning time ( at a given spin speed ) , which is consistent with trends inferred from SEM ( top panel Figure 1b - e ) . Most crystal grains are oriented in the [ 001 ] direction and the surface orientation propagates throughout the whole film ( Figure S10 , Supporting Information ) . On sam ples with larger than average grain size , however , the popula tion becomes more dispersed to higher index orientations of [ 101 ] and [ 111 ] because of many smaller crystal grains trapped among adjacent larger grains ( bottom panel Figure 1b - e ) . The mean of the distribution of apparent grain sizes obtained from optical images differs from the mean of the distribution obtained using EBSD ( Figure 1 g , the method in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information ) . Typically the difference is less than 40 % , but in one particular case ( orange trace ) , the optical images indicate an average grain size of more than a factor of 1.9 larger than the actual grain size . Figure 1f shows the ori gins of this discrepancy between an SEM image and its corre sponding EBSD map . Some pixels of the map show no Kikuchi pattern , for instance , area 4 ; this indicates a disordered region , which could contain amorphous ( not fully crystallized ) mate rial , [ 31 ] nanocrystalline perovskite with grains much smaller than our interaction volume ( ≈250 nm based on Monte Carlo simulation ; Figure S6 , Supporting Information ) or a com posite of the two . From EBSD data alone , we also can not rule out the influence of surface roughness ( Figure S9 , Supporting Information ) . The observation of disordered regions occurs primarily in the sample with an average grain size of 32 µm . In the optical image , such regions would be incorrectly classi fied as part of their neighboring grains . Furthermore , the iden tical Kikuchi patterns between domains 1 and 2 in Figure 1f ( across the dashed line ) indicate that they are one grain , while their morphology ( based on the SEM ) suggests there is a grain boundary . In another area ( solid line in Figure 1f ) , the SEM suggests there is no grain boundary but the EBSD map shows that one is present .",674,29150074_3,2

We checked that this method , while approximate ( it assumes ν ν b , where ν b is the break frequency of the synchrotron spectrum , which is a reasonable assumption ) provides consistent results with those of spectral modeling ( see also Bruno et al . 2019 ) . We used the minimum energy loss field B = B CM B / √ 3 = 3.4µG ( see de Gasperin et al . 2017 ) , that maximizes the radiative lifetime of the emitting particles ( we also verified that assuming equipartition returns consistent results ) . The injection index Γ was set to 0.7 ( typical values can range from 0.5 to 0.9 , see Biava et al . 2021 and refer - ences therein ) . Since , with the available uv - sampling at 4.8 GHz , we recover flux from the extended lobes only at the ∼2σ level , our results suffer from relatively large uncertainties ( up to a factor of 2 ) . As a note of caution , we observe that using B = 3.4µG and neglecting adiabatic expansion losses of the relativistic electrons results in possibly overestimated radiative ages ; adopting steeper values of Γ would result in even lower ages . On the other hand , the spectrum of the integrated flux from the cavity regions could also be described with a continuous injection model ( Pacholczyk 1970 ) , which would result in higher radiative ages than those predicted using Eq . 5 . These arguments are particularly important for the Nf cavity : assuming Γ ∼ 0.8 - 0.9 ( close to the observed spectral index ) would result in its radiative age being close to zero . However , a detailed comparison between different models and injection indices goes beyond the accuracy that can be reached with the available radio data , which only provide approximate radiative ages . Fig . 3 shows a sampling of the spectral indices with beam - sized ellipses ( 1.6 × 1.1 ) in the E - W ( blue ellipses in panel a ) and N - S ( red ellipses ) directions . The spectral index profiles ( panel c ) show no strong steepening towards the outer regions : the innermost region has a spectral index of ∼1 ( consistent with Gitti et al . 2006 ) , which is steeper than typical core emission ; however , this may be explained by the relatively large beam ( 1.6 × 1.1 ) , which does not resolve the core - jet components . The t rad profiles show that from the center to the outer regions the E - W radiative ages range between 15 - 35 Myr , while the N - S ones range between 15 - 25 Myr . Additionally , we computed the integrated flux from the cavity regions to obtain the radiative ages within each feature ( last column in Tab . 1 ) . The E - W ages are consistent with both buoyancy , sound speed and refill times . For the N - S cavities , we only have upper limits ; the Nf cavity has t rad ≈14 Myr , which is lower than the timescales suggested by buoyancy and refill ages , and is closer to the sound speed age .",600,239658990_52,2

A comparison of the fitted Urbach models to the absorbance data is given in Figure S5a - c , showing that there is a good fit . If we compare the Urbach models themselves to observe the absorption only due to the tail of sub - bandgap states , we can see that as the conduction band was raised , the energy required for sub - bandgap absorption also increased ( Figure S5d ) . This is in agreement with the photoluminescence spectra data in Figure 3b and suggests that the available electron acceptor levels due to any sub - bandgap states below the Zn 1 - x Mg x O conduction band were shifted to higher energies as the conduction band was shifted upwards by Mg doping .",186,235257256_6,2

648a3a111b9b6784788b85f8,237769565,Synthese,20,"Once that implicit contents are brought to the foreground two related questions arise : ( a ) what is the nature of the implicit information conveyed by extensionally equivalent frames sharing the same explicit contents ? And ( b ) how is the implicit information conveyed by the frames ? Drawing on some empirical data presented below , my answer to the first question is that the ( choice - relevant ) implicit information conveyed by the frame is about the most likely context of use of a frame , that is , the typical background conditions corresponding to such context . This information is not part of what is asserted in the frame , but rather part of what is assumed about context whenever a certain frame is employed . The resulting assumption concerns neither the intentions of any particular speaker , nor any other particular contextual aspect surrounding the framed utterance , since surveys are usually non - conversational contexts where both the "" speaker "" ( pollster ) and the framed issue are absent . In implicitly conveying information typically associated with a frame , valence framing induces an addition of a proposition to that literally expressed by an utterance , which bring us to the second question . The propositional addition induced by framing seems to occur through the activation of a default mechanism resulting from a process of standardization , i.e. by way of a regular pattern of use or choice of a frame whenever certain contextual conditions are assumed to be the case . As we will see , this is also suggested by recent empirical data on frame choice .",277,211424645_23,2

We can not directly generalize beyond these cases . What we can do though is ponder to what extent these findings are particular to these cases by exploring what core mechanisms were at play and contemplate whether these mechanisms may also be at play elsewhere . Here of course the cases we studied in Chine exist in an authoritarian and developing legal context , where regulators have limited autonomy , and where there have been structural instances of capture and corruption . All of these may well play a role in explaining our results , although we did not find direct evidence that they did . Another important particularity of the cases studied in China is the role of legal counsel . As explained in the methods section , legal counsel in China has until recently not been involved directly with everyday compliance processes , and nor did we find any trace of such involvement in the cases we studied . Thus , it may well be that in jurisdictions where there has been a more developed compliance function in an internal legal department or as a separate department run by lawyers that transmission of legal rules would have been more successful . Work by Edelman and Talesh has shown how in - house counsel play a role in the reception and transmission of legal norms into corporations , and by doing so adapt what the law is to the context of the corporation , thus changing its original meaning and function ( Edelman 1992;Edelman et al . 1991;Edelman and Talesh 2011b ) . Such work , however has not traced the transmission of the law deeper into the company .

RESULTS Figure 1 shows the angular power spectrum of the arrival directions of the simulated UHECR up to order l max = 64 for particles reaching the Earth with energies E > 8 EeV , E > 10 EeV , or E > 15 EeV. Remarkably , for all three energy ranges our results show a statistically significant ( s > 5σ ) dipolar anisotropy , whereas on smaller solid angle scales the distribution of the arrival directions is always compatible with an isotropic directional distribution . The significant dipolar anisotropy with no higher - order anisotropies for arrival energies E > 8 EeV ( see Fig . 1a ) is in excellent agreement with the latest data of the Pierre Auger Observatory . In a recent study , the Pierre Auger Collaboration reported a significant ( s > 5σ ) dipolar anisotropy ( Aab et al . 2017c ) , whereas an earlier study found isotropy for the higher - order multipole moments ( Aab et al . 2017b ) . Similarly , our results for arrival energies E > 10 EeV ( see Fig . 1b ) are well in line with O. Deligny for the Pierre Auger Collaboration and Telescope Array Collaboration ( 2015 ) , which mentions indications of a dipolar anisotropy for the same energy range . This finding , however , is not statistically significant with reference to a significance level of 5σ , but based on our simulation results we can expect that the dipolar anisotropy in the experimental data will become significant as soon as enough data are available . O. Deligny for the Pierre Auger Collaboration and Telescope Array Collaboration ( 2015 ) also considers higher - order contributions to the angular power spectrum up to order l = 20 and finds that they are compatible with isotropy . This is again consistent with our simulations and we predict that one will find no significant anisotropy also for even larger l when they are addressed in experiments in the near future . Our results for arrival energies E > 15 EeV ( see Fig . 1c ) are predictions that we expect to get confirmed by future experimental studies . We are not aware of any relevant studies considering the angular power spectrum of the arrival directions of UHECR in this energy range .

Motivated by our previous work , we have introduced a piece - wize parametrization for the nuclear effects in the PDFs . Originally , the fit functions contained altogether 42 parameters . With the help of momentum and baryon number conservation and the experience from EKS98 , we reduce the number of relevant fit parameters down to 16 . A best fit to the nuclear DIS and DY data was searched for this set of parameters through automated minimization of χ 2 using the Minuit program [ 37 ] . As a result , a very good fit to the N = 514 data points at Q 2 ≥ 1.69 GeV 2 was found , giving χ 2 /N = 0.789 ( or χ 2 /d.o.f . = 0.82 ) . No essential improvement over EKS98 was found , however , as the EKS98 modifications lead to an equally good fit quality , χ 2 /N = 0.809 ( for N = 479 datapoints at Q 2 ≥ Q 2 0,EKS98 ) . Relative to the old EKS98 , the present analysis suggests slightly less shadowing for the gluons and sea quarks . This , however , is merely due to the different forms of the fit functions adopted in the region where no stringent constraints from the data are available . We also compared the obtained nuclear effects to those obtained by other global analyses , HKM , HKN , and nDS . The valence quark modifications do not deviate much from one set to another but the smallest - x and large - x modifications of gluons and sea quarks differ in a major way . This reflects the fact that especially the nuclear gluons are badly constrained in these regions .",320,251656040_405,2

648a50e31b9b678478fe4338,3573161,Neural Information Processing Systems,57,"Comparison to heuristic methods We first compare SEAL with methods that only use graph structure features . We include eight popular heuristics ( shown in Appendix A , Table 3 ): common neighbors ( CN ) , Jaccard , preferential attachment ( PA ) , Adamic - Adar ( AA ) , resource allocation ( RA ) , Katz , PageRank ( PR ) , and SimRank ( SR ) . We additionally include Ensemble ( ENS ) which trains a logistic regression classifier on the eight heuristic scores . We also include two heuristic learning methods : Weisfeiler - Lehman graph kernel ( WLK ) [ 34 ] and WLNM [ 12 ] , which also learn from ( truncated ) enclosing subgraphs . We omit path ranking methods [ 28 ] as well as other recent methods which are specifically designed for knowledge graphs or recommender systems [ 23,35 ] . As all the baselines only use graph structure features , we restrict SEAL to not include any latent or explicit features . In SEAL , the hop number h is an important hyperparameter . Here , we select h only from { 1 , 2 } , since on one hand we empirically verified that the performance typically does not increase after h ≥ 3 , which validates our theoretical results that the most useful information is within local structures . On the other hand , even h = 3 sometimes results in very large subgraphs if a hub node is included . This raises the idea of sampling nodes in subgraphs , which we leave to future work . The selection principle is very simple : If the second - order heuristic AA outperforms the first - order heuristic CN on 10 % validation data , then we choose h = 2 ; otherwise we choose h = 1 . For datasets PB and E.coli , we consistently use h = 1 to fit into the memory . We include more details about the baselines and hyperparameters in Appendix D.   Table 1 shows the results . Firstly , we observe that methods which learn from enclosing subgraphs ( WLK , WLNM and SEAL ) generally perform much better than predefined heuristics . This indicates that the learned "" heuristics "" are better at capturing the network properties than manually designed ones . Among learning - based methods , SEAL has the best performance , demonstrating GNN 's superior graph feature learning ability over graph kernels and fully - connected neural networks . From the results on Power and Router , we can see that although existing heuristics perform similarly to random guess , learning - based methods still maintain high performance . This suggests that we can even discover new "" heuristics "" for networks where no existing heuristics work . Comparison to latent feature methods Next we compare SEAL with six state - of - the - art latent feature methods : matrix factorization ( MF ) , stochastic block model ( SBM ) [ 18 ] , node2vec ( N2V ) [ 20 ] , LINE [ 21 ] , spectral clustering ( SPC ) , and variational graph auto - encoder ( VGAE ) [ 36 ] . Among them , VGAE uses a GNN too . Please note the difference between VGAE and SEAL : VGAE uses a node - level GNN to learn node embeddings that best reconstruct the network , while SEAL uses a graph - level GNN to classify enclosing subgraphs . Therefore , VGAE still belongs to latent feature methods . For SEAL , we additionally include the 128 - dimensional node2vec embeddings in the node information matrix X. Since the datasets do not have node attributes , explicit features are not included . Table 2 shows the results . As we can see , SEAL shows significant improvement over latent feature methods . One reason is that SEAL learns from both graph structures and latent features simultaneously , thus augmenting those methods that only use latent features . We observe that SEAL with node2vec embeddings outperforms pure node2vec by large margins . This implies that network embeddings alone may not be able to capture the most useful link prediction information located in the local structures . It is also interesting that compared to SEAL without node2vec embeddings ( Table 1 ) , joint learning does not always improve the performance .

To reduce dependency on the input data samples , [ 13 ] maximizes layer activations of the source network while [ 14 ] extracts deluding perturbations using class impressions relying on the source label space . To enhance the transferability of instance - agnostic approaches , recent generative models attempt to directly craft perturbations using an adversarially trained function [ 15,16 ] .

The UPR comprises the principal signaling pathways that involve inositol - requiring enzyme 1 ( IRE1 ) , ( PERK ) , and ATF6 [ 86 ] . All these genes play critical roles in the UPR adaptive system . We quantified the expression of the established ERS markers IRE1 , PERK , ATF6 , and ATF4 , to determine the effects of PtNPs on ERS in THP-1 cells incubated with various concentrations of PtNPs for 24 h. Platinum NPs obviously induced all of these stress markers at all applied concentrations ( Figure 8) . These data showed that PtNPs cause ERS and associated UPR induction in THP-1 cells . Christen et al . [ 87 ] reported that silica NPs induce ERS through the activation of ATF-4 , BiP , and X - box binding protein 1 ( XBP-1s ) in Huh7 cells . The IRE1 gene induces apoptosis by activating apoptosis signaling kinase 1 ( ASK1 ) and interacting with tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factor ( TRAF)2 . Excessive and prolonged ER stress ultimately causes apoptosis by promoting the expression of CCAAT / enhancer - binding protein homologous protein ( CHOP ) [ 88][89][90 ] .

Such range is calculated based on two displacement emission factors which are dynamically computed on an annual basis according to the evolution of the future energy mix . The first factor considers that WE will replace future high - carbon generation providing an upper limit of potential CO 2 emissions avoided . The second factor considers that WE will displace not only high - carbon but also other lowcarbon generation resulting in a lower limit . This method clearly outperforms the displacement estimation methods used in the literature from a scientific point of view since the displacement emission factors are updated periodically . Since this method takes into account how each technology generation evolves , it enables a meaningful comparison of potential CO 2 emissions avoided by WE across countries with high differences among their energy mixes . Furthermore , it avoids an overestimation of the CO 2 emissions abated in those power systems that will become highly decarbonised in the long - term . Additionally , the proposed method may be extended and used to other non - EU regions given the evolution of their respective energy mixes .

L ignification is therefore concluded , as originally theorised , [ 176 ] to be simply ac hemical reaction , independent of proteinaceous control . [ 155,158,168 ] DFT calculations performed on molecular models have predicted values of bond dissociation energy ( BDE ) for the b - O-4 bond between 54 and 72 kcal mol À1 . [ 177][178][179][180 ] Notably , substituent effects can have as ignificant impact on the BDE of a b - O-4 bond . Fore xample , o xidation of the ahydroxy group to ak etone was found to lower the BDE by 15 kcal mol À1 . [ 178 ] Ap henylcoumaran unit B has afive - membered ring that results from internal trapping of the intermediate quinone methide by the phenolic - OH following the b-5 coupling   [ 160 ] ( Scheme 5 ) . Again it is racemic , but the ring - closure is transselective such that there is only asingle isomer of the dimeric unit . DFT calculations predict the a - O-4 bond of phenylcoumaran molecular models to have alow value of BDE ( 50 - 56 kcal mol À1 ) , suggesting that these structural motifs can easily undergo radical cleavage under conditions of high severity .",716,119236332_59,2

[ 3 ] NCS was used as the control serum . HCs from the GO , GO - N 3 , GO≡ , and C 2 GO were detached from the graphene using a buffer solution at 95 ° C for 5 - 10 min ( see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for formulation ) and analyzed in technical duplicates . The profiling results obtained by LC - MS were expressed as relative protein abundance ( RPA ) in percentage , as shown in Figure 2A. The top 30 proteins with more than 0.5 % total protein RPA in at least one of the HC samples were selected for further analysis . The protein recovery from the top 30 proteins was 99+% for all HC samples . Other HC proteins found with < 0.5 % total protein RPA were neglected for further analysis . Each of the selected 30 HC proteins was ranked within each HC sample by the RPA ( relative protein abundance among the 30 proteins ) , color - mapped and compared with the RPA of the control serum ( see Table S2 in the Supporting Information for summarized protein information ) . Each graphene - HC RPA profile was regarded as 30 variables and analyzed using multivariate analysis ( MVA ) , i.e. , principal component analysis ( PCA ) . PCA reduces the data into a smaller number of artificial variables known as the principal components ( PC ) , that is , the linear combinations of the original variables ( 30 protein RPA per graphene type ) . The PC that accounts for ( explained ) the most , and the second most variances in the data ( i.e. , most of the data variances are happening along the PC coordinate ) is known as the first PC ( PC-1 ) and the second PC ( PC-2 ) , respectively . [ 19 ] Two PC analyses were performed . First , RPA% of the control serum and the graphene - HCs was first analyzed to see if the serum RPA% is significantly different from the graphene - HC RPA% , i.e. , to verify if graphene - HC RPA% is uniquely different from the serum . Second , the 4 graphene - HC RPA% were compared with each other to verify if the HC profile is significantly different . In brief , each HC profiling RPA% data can be considered as a vector in 30D space ( each sample has 30 RPA measurements ) . Dimensionality reduction was performed by Eigenanalysis of the correlation matrix ( where the variables are standardized ; otherwise the proteins with small RPA would not contribute much to the analysis ) . The Eigenvalues ( the fold changes / stretches of the Eigenvectors after linear transformation , i.e. , the vector scalar ) and the Eigenvectors of each PCs were obtained . Eigenvalues are shown in the PC screening plots ( Figure S5A1 , Supporting Information ) , to identify the number of the PCs needed to explain most of the variance in the data . The higher the PC Eigenvalue , the more variances are explained ; for the first PCA analysis , since the PC-1a and PC-2a combined would cover +80 % of the total Eigenvalues combined , the 30D vector can be dimensionally reduced into a 2D subspace while still capturing +80 % of the variance in the data , i.e. , the critical data information was maintained . The loading plot provides additional visual interpretation of the PC correlation by plotting the Eigenvectors of each variable for PC-1a and PC-2a ( Figure 2B1 and Figure S5A2 ( Supporting Information ) ) . The PC-1a and PC-2a scores ( shown in Figure 2B2 ) are the linear combinations of the original data . The larger the absolute value of the variable Eigenvector ( either positive or negative ) , the greater importance of the corresponding variables ( proteins ) in calculating the PCs . Positive and negative Eigenvectors contribute to positive and negative PC scores , respectively . From Figure 2B2 , a clear separation between serum - RPA profile and graphene - RPA profile based on PC-1a can be seen , i.e. , there is a definite difference in the protein composition for the control serum and all the graphene - HC . Proteins with positive PC-1a Eigenvector values ( 24 out of 30 proteins tested ) were found to have higher RPA on graphene derivatives , i.e. , to have higher graphene binding affinity resulting in uniquely different graphene - HC profiles that are significantly different from the background serum protein profile ( Figure 2B2 , xaxis ) .",815,236215611_49,2

[ 52 ] Hence , both SWV and UPS experiments reveal that for these DPP polymers , and their solar cells with PCBM , the linear correlation between V oc and ( E HOMO , D − E LUMO , A ) has a slope less than unity . In contrast , we note that Scharber et al . , in a study on 26 different bulk heterojunction blends , found a correlation with a slope equal to 1 between V oc and the redox potential difference .

[ 52,55 ] At present , it is not possible to resolve the discrepancies between these various studies . Nevertheless , it is of interest to consider possible explanations for our finding of a slope < 1 . One effect to be considered is the dependence of the generation rate G on the HOMO level .

For highly functional optical microresonators , the important requirements of the material platforms are ultralow optical loss , wide transparent window , high index contrast , high nonlinearities , and industry compatible fabrication processes .

Recently , silicon carbide ( SiC ) has generated significant attention for its superior material properties to match all the essential requirements . As a mature wide bandgap material , SiC has a wide bandgap ( 3.26 eV for 4H polytypes ) , a high refractive index ( 2.6 at 1550 nm ) and a wide transparent window ( 0.37 - 5.6 μm ) 12 , which can avoid multiple photon absorption that bothers the Si photonics .

Each era is driven by its own storytelling conventions , which are frequently considered superior to the storytelling conventions of prior eras . As is commonly known , Socrates despised the written word , for he considered writing to be a deeply inhuman practice and found that true knowledge could only emerge through words as spoken between active human minds engaged in conversation . By contrast , Plato valued Socrates ' use of allegory and saw the written word as a way of preserving the power of the spoken word as a pathway to knowledge . In modernity , visual depictions of knowledge come to be considered truer and thus superior to other verbal or written forms of knowledge ( e.g. Ong , 1982 ) . Big Data visualizations reflect and amplify these tendencies . Visual depictions of knowledge are not exempt from the same fallacies to which oral and print cultures of communicating knowledge are susceptible , especially when they are often rendered out of audiovisual representations of words . Neither are Big Data analyses , which are in fact meta - analysis of words , put together in a curious and novel blend of interpersonal communication and broadcasting practices -of oral and written storytelling traditions . But they do reinforce and reproduce a form of communicating knowledge that I have been referring to as a digital orality . 1 Orality is used to describe forms of storytelling and knowledge sharing that characterize every epoch . If our goal is to grasp how the technologies of an era afford opportunities for communicating knowledge , then orality describes the form , the texture , the tonality that communication takes on . For example , oral storytelling traditions were driven by a fluidity , spontaneity , and reflexivity in sharing knowledge . Ong ( 1982 ) explained that within a primary orality , the nature of the word is not visible but lives in the world of sound . Thus , storytelling ' comes into being in the present even though it normally may derive variously from a tradition , a past ' , and evolves as the voice of storytelling changes ( Ong , 1995 : 1 ) . So knowledge is communicated and constantly evolves as it is communicated . The form of sharing organically changes and evolves as knowledge is reproduced through the spoken word , to listening publics who are aware that this evolving continuity is part of the essence of communicating knowledge . By contrast , the logic and technologies of secondary orality introduced and reproduced the deliberate spontaneity of a writing and print culture , which evolved as electronic and computermediated texts accompanied by a secondary orality with a secondary visualism . Ong ( 1982 ) had suggested that the logic of a secondary orality is not dependent on sounding out stories , in the way that primary orality was . So , in this sense a secondary orality mutes out the subjectivity inherent in voicing this stories , in favor of generating ' technologized ' , ' permanent ' , and thus ' silent ' stories that distance ( Ong , 1982 ) . An example of this form of distance is encountered within the paradigm of journalistic objectivity , which requires narrators to establish objective distance from the story so as to ascertain accuracy and thus electronically reproduce and share verified information . This distance is eliminated in the subjective form of oral storytelling , however , which affectively evolves as it circulates in the oral tradition . Different forms of orality open up different avenues to knowledge , in fact , to situated knowledges . No one form of orality leads to truer articulations of knowledge . What is important is to understand the texture of the path to ( situated ) knowledge each orality opens up .",678,237149547_32,2

The sector 's recovery and growth largely depend upon tourists and their behavioural responses ; among the key factors that can be expected to influence such responses are personality traits . This follows from the fact that personality traits , which are innate as well as consciously nurtured , can be triggered by the situations that occur in people 's lives ( McLeod , 2016 ) .

There are , however , many other dimensions of firm responses , such as whether firms communicate their response to individual consumers or to the public at large . Future research may examine impression management ( McDonnell and King 2013 ) and greenwashing effects in relation to firm response strategies ( Lyon and Montgomery 2013;Seele and Gatti 2015 ) .

While Google Trends data have been popular input in several studies to measure public interest , the risk of multicollinearity escalates with the addition of more relevant terms in such studies . Therefore , effective methods must be developed and implemented to maximize the benefit of the information from such data sources . With the developed novel algorithm , our methodology effectively handles multicollinearity and lags in covariates while ensuring that all model - included covariates are statistically significant . These considerations allow the results to be readily interpretable . Consumer mobility is defined as the aggregated , and anonymized movement pattern observed among consumers based on their mobile device location . Further , retail mobility refers specifically to consumer movement trends for retail locations such as grocery stores , restaurants , and shopping centers .",265,20664522_136,2

Assume that you know all the relevant facts about the case ( the number of tickets , the price , that the lottery is fair ) . In a KBDT , Naoko 's decision could be represented as follows 38 : 36 These data are explicitly used by KBDT theorists as evidence for their view . We do not consider here a range of further data traditionally deployed in support of knowledge - action principles , such as direct criticisms of the reasonability of one 's actions . An example is Hawthorne and Stanley 's restaurant case , in which a driver is criticized for taking the wrong street on the basis that she did n't know that was the right direction . The reason is that even philosophers endorsing such principles tend not to consider these as compelling cases for KAP . For recent examples see Littlejohn ( 2020 , § 1 ) and Moss ( 2018a , p. 197 ) , who claims that such cases are "" suggestive but not decisive "" , since they are susceptible to alternative equally intuitive explanations ( cfr . Brown , 2008 , Cresto 2010 , Fassio 2017 , Gerken 2011 , Neta 2009 , Schiffer 2007 ) . 37 The present example is a variant of one discussed in Hawthorne and Stanley ( 2008 , p. 572 ) . 38 For simplicity 's sake in this representation of the situation we assume that in this specific situation utility is equal to monetary value . One may argue that this is an unrealistic assumption : monetary value has always a decreasing marginal utility due to risk aversion . This consideration may be correct , but does n't affect the validity of our general point . We can obtain the same result by modifying specific details of the case , such as the number of tickets or the lottery price . Assuming decreasing marginal utility would just add unnecessary complications . In this case , the expected value of selling the ticket is higher than that of keeping it ( 0.5 > 0.4 ) . Thus , in a KBDT , it is fully rational for Naoko to sell her ticket for few cents : this is the choice that maximizes expected value . This verdict conflicts with our ordinary folk appraisals about the case , according to which Naoko should n't sell her ticket for a few pennies . Far from providing the best explanation of such appraisals , KBDT provides diagnoses which conflict with such intuitive judgments .",446,237792009_33,2

This could be seen as a kind of pluralism : perhaps everyday reasoning relies on a logic other than the one employed in mathematics and some sciences .

These strategies usually assume that there exists a common latent space where modalities can express the same semantic concept through a set of transformations of the raw data . The semantic embedding representations are such that two concepts are similar if and only if their semantic embeddings are close ( Norouzi et al . , 2014 ) . In ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) a multimodal strategy to perform zero - shot classification was proposed . They trained a word - based neural network model ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) to represent textual information , whilst use unsupervised feature learning models proposed in ( Coates & Ng , 2011 ) to get image representation . The fusion was done by learning an image linear mapping to project images into the semantic word space learned in the neural network model . Additionally a Bayesian framework was included to decide whether an image is of a seen or unseen class . Frome et al . ( 2013 ) learn the image representation using a CNN trained with the Imagenet dataset and a word - based neural language model ( Mikolov et al . , 2013b ) to represent the textual modality .

Instead of re - train the CNN network , they built a convex combination with probabilities estimated by the classifier and semantic embedding vector of the unseen label .

648a398e1b9b678478887d3f,236090435,Advanced Materials,40,"Raman spectroscopy also provides a useful approach to measure microstructure alignment . Many reports acquire a sense of the anisotropy simply by changing the direction of polarization of the inbound Raman laser to the sample , with the polarization parallel and then perpendicular to the direction of microstructure alignment . The intensity change of some Raman spectra feature , typically the G peak at ≈1580 cm −1 , indicates the degree of microstructure alignment . For aligned MWCNTs , Raman anisotropy values range between 1 and 10 [ 134,275,209,274,315,316,317 ] and , again for aligned FWCNTs , they range higher between 1 and 107 . [ 14,27,28,181,186,190,196,209,218,277,318 ] For the nearly perfectly packed and aligned SWCNT bucky paper , the Raman spectroscopy alignment ratio rose to 160 .

[ 92,294,316,319 ] This Raman technique does not consider the CNT 's significant optical absorption of the inbound laser , which itself is alignment - dependent . Further , this technique does not take into account polarized Raman - shifted radiation going from the sample to the spectrometer . These factors make comparison across different studies difficult and render Raman anisotropy values more of a qualitative indicator of anisotropy than relating directly to a physical material property . Addressing these subtleties , more sophisticated treatments [ 9,181,276 ] of Raman spectroscopy yield physical alignment metrics , although are not widely enough utilized in the literature for analysis here . Still , we plot the simple Raman G peak anisotropy values across the literature ( Figure 8b ) versus conductivity and strength ; correlation data are provided in Tables 15 and 16 . For aligned FWCNT materials , while no correlation is apparent for strength , there is the expected positive correlation between conductivity and Raman anisotropy . The correlation does not survive the weighted adjustment however and this signals undue bias from specific studies . For aligned MWCNT materials , again there is the opposite behavior of what was expected - a negative correlation between conductivity and Raman G peak anisotropy that is marginally maintained after the weighted adjustment .",379,248918510_33,2

648a441f1b9b678478ba1d6c,233828232,Advanced Energy Materials,61,"Modelling Framework : All models were constructed using numerical calculations in MATLAB where the catalyst and absorbent beds were discretized into differential segments where the concentration of all species is considered constant . The number of discretizations in each bed was a minimum of 100 , but typically ≈1000 unless many beds were considered in series ( i.e. , combined catalyst - absorbent system ) . The time step of the numerical models was calculated as the time for the gas phase to pass through each discretization such that the effect of void volume in the reactor / absorber was also considered . For the catalyst model , a conventional power law relation was implemented in which each kinetic parameter was determined using a distinct characteristic in the temperature - conversion profile obtained ( Figure 1d ) . The order of reaction for N 2 and H 2 in the forward reaction was determined by varying the pressure of N 2 and H 2 independently and measuring rate of reaction ( Figure 1f ) . These orders were confirmed by the increased catalytic activity as the N 2 : H 2 ratio increased from 1:3 to 1:1 and 2:1 . The rate constant for the forward reaction was calculated from an Arrhenius plot when conversion is < 5 % . Generating a model for the catalyst which included high conversion required discretization in 1000 segments because the reactor is no longer differential when the reverse reaction becomes significant . The reverse rate constant was determined assuming that the forward and reverse rates must be equal at equilibrium for 1:3 N 2 : H 2 . The order of reaction for NH 3 in the reverse reaction was determined by matching the discretized model with the curvature of the maximum conversion data . A higher order results in a model that reaches higher peak conversions because the reverse reaction requires a higher concentration of ammonia before it becomes significant relative to the forward reaction . Conversely , a lower order model achieves lower conversions because the reverse reaction needs to begin resisting the forward reaction at lower conversions if it will also maintain a hardstop at equilibrium . Finally , the order of reaction for H 2 in the reverse reaction due to inhibition was determined using the constraint that the equilibrium is followed for N 2 : H 2 ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 ( i.e. , a negative reaction order causes the conversion at high temperatures to decrease as N 2 : H 2 increases because the reverse reaction becomes faster ) . This catalyst model is applicable at the wide range of temperatures , pressures , and N 2 : H 2 ratios expected for a typical analysis .",461,54678870_11,2

Polarization modulation is achieved with a rotary , linear polarized light that irradiated the sample at different polarization angles ( Fig . 1a ) by a rotatory halfwave plate ( HWP ) . The hardware was identical to a linear dichroism system , in which the fluorescence signal excited at specific polarization angle was simultaneously recorded under a custom Epi microscopy ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . The HWP was mounted on a motorized rotation stage in synchronization with camera ( Fig . 1b ,   top ) . To ensure linear polarization after the dichroic filter , a Berek Polarization Compensator ( BPC , New Focus TM ) was employed ( Fig . S3b ) . According to the truth , each rotation of the motor generates a pulse , the rising or falling edge between the two pulses could be considered as a motor period , so the modulation angle of excitation at each frame was determined by the captured frame pulse of the camera recorded synchronously . The motor rotates once and the polarization direction of excitation rotates twice , that is 4 modulation cycles , named as 4 OLID cycles ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . The lower panel in Fig . 1b shows the periodic sinusoidal response of fluorescence emission from the rotational polarized excitation ( Supplementary Note 2 - 3 ) . This signal can be exactly used for accurate frequency domain lock - in amplification because it carries a fixed frequency . The orientation was obtained by extracting the phase difference between the fluorescence intensity curve ( Fig . 1b , bottom ) and the standard modulation curve .

At each iteration of this iterative method , the model parameters are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function typically evaluated on a mini - batch , with step size controlled by a learning rate . While vanilla SGD uses a common learning rate across coordinates ( possibly varying across time ) , several adaptive learning rate algorithms have been developed that scale the gradient coordinates by square roots of some form of average of the squared values of past gradients coordinates . The first key approach in this class , ADAGRAD [ 2,3 ] , uses a per - coordinate learning rate based on squared past gradients , and has been found to outperform vanilla SGD on sparse data . However , in non - convex dense settings where gradients are dense , performance is degraded , since the learning rate shrinks too rapidly due to the accumulation of all past squared gradient in its denominator . To address this issue , variants of ADAGRAD have been proposed that use the exponential moving average ( EMA ) of past squared gradients to essentially restrict the window of accumulated gradients to only few recent ones .

As the cleavage of the reporter RNA is a time - dependent process , the prolongation of the incubation increases the amount of cleaved RNA and , therefore , reduces the amperometric signal ( Figure S14 , Supporting Information ) . To decrease the limit of detection furthermore , a calibration curve with an extended incubation time of the mixture solution for 7 h ( Figure S15 , Supporting Information ) and 24 h is recorded ( Figure 2c ) . Contraintuitive , we could not observe an improvement of the LOD for a 7 h cleavage time . In our opinion , this is due to the very low concentration of the target miRNA and the therewith resulting lack of active Cas13a enzymes in the solution . This leads to an unsatisfactory total catalytic activity of the effector with a very low reaction rate , which is not sufficient for a further significant signal reduction at very low concentrations of the target miRNA within 7 h of incubation . Comparing the different cleavage times in terms of sensor performance , a minimum LOD of 2 pm was achieved after a 24 h incubation , while a maximum dynamic range of roughly two orders of magnitude can be seen , at a cleavage time of only 1 h , along with a LOD of 18 pm ( Figure 2a ) . In general , the longer the cleavage time , the lower the limit of detection and the lower the dynamic range of the resulting calibration curve ( Table S6 , Supporting Information ) .

We find that the percentage of older adults negatively correlates with per capita mobility ( r = −0.29 ) , and thus neglect of demography - specific mortality risk will lead to inaccurate estimation of risk for different age groups . By contrast , our proposed BD model finds differences in mobility behaviors outweighed by the change in IFRs due to age structure and predicts higher mortality risk in communities with higher percentages of older adults , consistent with previous research ( 24,40 ) . Moreover , communities with lower average household incomes and higher percentages of essential workers are associated with higher levels of mobility , likely following from limitations in their ability to significantly reduce mobility during the pandemic ( 26,31,32 ) .

Raman scattering spectra measurements were carried out on a T64000 Raman system ( Horiba Jobin Yvon ) at room temperature . The excitation source was the 514 nm laser line of an air cooled Ar - ion laser . The thickness of the cermet fi lms were measured with an Alpha - step 200 Profi lometer ( Tencor ) . The growth rates of metal and dielectric layers were measured by a quartz crystal monitor equipped in the sputterring system . The morphology and roughness of the fi lms were measured with a Veeco Dimensions 3000 AFM . The spectral bidirectional refl ectance were measured at room temperature with a spectrophotometer by Varian ( Cary 500i , angle of incidence 8 ° , absolute spectral refl ectance accessory ) covering the wavelength range of 0.3 - 1.8 µm , and with an FT - IR Spectrometer by Thermo Scientifi c ( Nicolet 6700 , angle of incidence 12 ° ) covering the wavelength range of 1.8 - 20 µm . The latter ( relative measurement ) required a reference with known spectral refl ectance , which was chosen to be a specular gold mirror ( Thorlabs ) . The indirectly obtained emittance values of solar absorbers from spectral refl ectance data measured close to room temperature signifi cantly underestimated the emittance at elevated temperature because it ignored the temperature dependence of the dielectric constants . [ 2,16 ] For that reason , the solar absorptance and total hemispherical emittance of a fabricated solar absorber ( S - W / SS ) with thermally stable and most promising spectral refl ectance data was directly measured at elevated temperatures ( up to 500 ° C ) using simple steady state calorimetric methods . [ 16 ] The sample was attached to a heater assembly and suspended in a vacuum chamber . The electrical heater power input was directly related to the radiation heat loss from the sample surface . Thus , the total hemispherical emittance could be calculated with the electrical heater power inputs and the measured sample and surrounding temperatures . The solar absorptance was measured at elevated temperatures using a solar simulator . The sample / heater assembly was suspended in the vacuum chamber facing a viewport allowing the solar simulator beam to irradiate the sample surface . The solar absorptance could be obtained by varying the incident radiation power onto the sample and measuring the corresponding electric heater power adjustments to maintain the sample surface at a constant temperature .",501,237583206_0,2
648a441f1b9b678478ba20f4,97979989,Advanced Energy Materials,13,"We verifi ed this effect fi rst by measuring the conductivity of a pristine PCBM fi lm and a PCBM fi lm containing a controlled amount of I − . The latter was realized by adding a Adv . Energy Mater . 2016 , 6 , 1501453 www.MaterialsViews.com www.advenergymat.de wileyonlinelibrary.com methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) solution ( 10 mg mL −1 in isopropanol ) to the pristine PCBM solution ( 30 mg mL −1 in CB ) with a ratio of 1:30 . In Figure 6 a , we compare the J -V plot of the two fi lms . For this test we chose symmetric gold contacts with a channel length of 200 µm in order to avoid contact resistance effects . The addition of the MAI salt to the PCBM results in a markedly increased conductivity , which changes from 6.43 × 10 −7 S m −1 for the pristine fi lm to 4.35 × 10 −6 S m −1 for the PCBM / MAI fi lm . This effect may be ascribed either to a chemical doping of the PCBM , i.e. , an excess of free carriers , or to an improved mobility , or both . In order to get deeper insights we tested the electronic properties of a PCBM fi lm and a PCBM / MAI fi lm in top gate / bottom contact fi eld - effect transistors ( FETs ) . By comparing the measurements ( Figure 6 b ) of the pristine PCBM and the MAI doped devices , we are able to extract useful information regarding the PCBM interaction with ions that validate the aforementioned PCBM / perovskite interaction . The extracted saturation mobility ( at V G = V D = 60 V ) results in being 5.9 × 10 −2 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for the pristine PCBM transistor - in agreement with literature values [ 27,28 ] -and 0.15 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for the doped PCBM / MAI device . The latter value is more than two times higher than the pristine PCBM one . The pristine PCBM device shows poorer subthreshold slope values and a higher threshold voltage ( 36.3 V , which reduces to 8.1 V upon doping ) , likely owing to deep trap states . The holes current tail exhibited at low gate voltages in the saturation regime by the pristine PCBM device ( V D = 60 V curve in Figure 4 c ) disappears in the MAI doped one , resulting in a suppressed hole conduction . At the same time , a marked increase of the nongateable OFF current in saturation in the MAI doped devices denotes a conductivity increase of the semiconducting fi lm , confi rming the results reported above for the two terminal devices ( in the linear regime the OFF currents are at the level of leakage and can not be compared ) . The generally increased performances ( Table 2 ) of the doped device , with respect to the pristine one , can be attributed according to the literature [ 29 ] to an increased concentration of excess carriers , as a consequence of chemical doping which shifts the Fermi level closer to the LUMO level of PCBM . To confi rm this we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) to investigate the energy levels of the same fi lms used in the transistors ( Figure 6 c ) . The limited penetration depth characteristic of UPS makes this investigation more suitable to explain the FET data , where a nanometer thick channel accumulates at the Adv . Energy Mater . 2016 , 6 , 1501453 www.MaterialsViews.com www.advenergymat.de   semiconductor - dielectric interface , rather than the two terminal samples data . By linear extrapolation from the high binding energy region of the spectrum we derive the position of the Fermi level for pristine PCBM and for the PCBM : MAI fi lm to be , respectively , at −4.27 and −4.13 eV. This is a relatively small but consistent shift of the Fermi level toward the vacuum level when the methylammonium salt is added to the fi lm , indicating a clear n - doping effect . From the Fermi level position , as a fi rst approximation , we have estimated the charge carrier density at thermal equilibrium in both fi lms on the basis of a single - crystal lattice model . [ 30 ] In the case of the pristine PCBM we determined an electron density of 2.5 × 10 11 cm −3 ; while for the PCBM : MAI fi lm a concentration of 5.7 × 10 13 cm −3 , two orders of magnitude higher respect to the pristine sample ( see the Supporting Information for the calculations ) . Thus , in the transistor deep trap states are fi lled by chemically introduced excess carriers , and as a consequence , for the same applied gate voltage , electrostatically accumulated carriers in the channel occupy more mobile states , thus producing a net shift in the threshold voltage and an increased fi eld - effect mobility . These results confi rm the interaction between ions and the PCBM that occurs at the interface between the perovskite and the PCBM , with the increased conductivity of the PCBM phase owing to an increased number of free carriers induced by I − doping .",912,237583058_50,2
648a444b1b9b678478bad423,208210153,Light-Science & Applications,9,"To confirm the imaging capability of our L - PAM - GS system using the agent - free localization method , we imaged black polystyrene particles in vitro and a mouse ear in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . S8 and Fig . 5 ) . In the in vitro experiment ( Supplementary Text ) , the standard deviation of the localized positions of a single particle , determining the enhanced spatial resolution , were 0.4 , 0.7 , and 2.5 μm ( x , y , and z directions , respectively ) 33 . We applied our localization method to the label - free PAM of small animals in vivo by localizing the PA signals induced by RBCs . L - PAM - GS is able to capture the RBCs instantaneously based on its fast temporal resolution and high SNR ( Fig . 5a ) . In addition , the PA signals in each frame , generated from the same RBC , can be localized at different positions under the flow condition . The L - PAM - GS image is finally rendered by superimposing all points localized in each frame ( Fig . 5b ) . In this experiment , a sequence of 60 images , each with a size of 1.5 mm × 1 mm ( x - and y - axis , respectively ) , was obtained , with a volumetric imaging speed of 2.5 Hz ( Fig . 5c ) . Our localization algorithm was applied to each volumetric frame to determine the local maximum points , and the maximum points were superimposed to render localization 2D PA MAP and 3D PA volume images ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Supplementary Movies 5 and 6 illustrate the actual 2D and 3D formations of the improved L - PAM - GS image from the sequence of 60 frames . The rotation movie of the localization volume image also shows the enhanced microvascular structures ( Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Supplementary Figure S9 shows the conventional and localization PA MAP images of the mouse ear along the yaxis . The imaging depths of both approaches are at least 320 μm , but these are not the maximum imaging depth because the thickness of the mouse ear is too thin to show the maximum imaging depth . To emphasize the enhanced   resolution , we enlarged two regions in Fig . 5c ( Fig . 5f , i ) and corresponding regions in the localization MAP image in Fig . 5d ( Fig . 5 g , j ) . The line profiles marked in the magnified images are displayed in Fig . 5h , k. The profiles of the green dashed line a - a′ in Fig . 5f and the blue dashed line b - b′ in Fig . 5 g are compared in Fig . 5h . Likewise , the profiles of the green dashed line c - c′ in Fig . 5i and the blue dashed line d - d′ in Fig . 5j are compared in Fig . 5k . As shown in Fig . 5h , the microvessels were clearly resolved into two separate microvessels by L - PAM - GS but were not resolved in the regular PA MAP image . In Fig . 5k , the regular PA profile shows only two microvessels , but the localization profile shows three detached microvessels . We also compared the B - mode images of the region highlighted by the green dashed line in Fig . 5c ( Fig . 5l ) with its corresponding localization Bmode image ( Fig . 5 m ) to prove the improvement in the axial direction . We compared the profiles of the green dashed line e - e′ in Fig . 5l and the blue dashed line f - f′ in Fig . 5 m ( Fig . 5n ) . The blood vessels that could not be resolved in the regular PA B - mode image are well separated in the localization B - mode image , and the profiles confirm this enhancement ( Fig . 5n ) . We compared the Bmode images of the conventional and localization OR - PAM , where a microvessel begins to bifurcate into two , to quantify the improvement in the spatial resolution ( Supplementary Fig . S10 and Supplementary Text ) . These results demonstrate that the improvement in the spatial resolution by a factor of 2.5 was achieved in vivo by an agent - free localization approach . To render a localization PA microvascular image , multiple volumetric data had to be acquired . Thanks to the fast imaging speed ( e.g. , B - scan rate of 500 Hz ) and high SNRs , our system could quickly track the localized PA signals from RBCs by obtaining multiple volumetric data within seconds .",820,235382144_52,3

Building upon these observations , we argue that scholars must examine the readiness of consumers to travel in the context of the pandemic by investigating the personality traits proposed by the fivefactor model as drivers of their intentions to travel during and after the pandemic . This approach enables us to respond to calls for research related to the recovery of the tourism sector even as the pandemic and its effects continue to loom large .

Specific databases with experimental data often only contain a few hundred data points , thus the majority of organic material databases instead contain computed data , where there are 10 000s of data points for a specific application , for example , the electronic band structures in the Organic Materials Database .

Colored ovals are sized to encompass 90 % of the data points and help identify trends . In the discussion of ampacity , ovals indicated 95 % confidence intervals . On the logarithmic data , for a given CNT category , the strength of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the probability ( p - value ) that it is significant were calculated . Probabilities less than or equal to 0.05 ( p ≤ 0.05 ) are deemed significant and colored green ; probabilities between 0.1 and 0.05 ( 0.05 ≤ p ≤ 0.1 ) are deemed possibly significant and colored gray . The fitted slope and standard error of the logarithmic data set were also calculated ; this slope is the exponent of the power - law . Different studies offer different amounts of data points , opening the possibility some studies could unduly skew the aggregated correlations by simply offering more points . To guard against undue bias from specific studies , correlation strength , power - law fit , and their probability ( p - value ) with a weighting function were also calculated . The weight is assigned to give each paper , within a material category and within the properties in question , equal impact to the correlation and fit . Correlations and fits that remain statistically significant and do not change much between unweighted and weighted calculation imply that the trends apply across the literature , opposed to a few specific studies . If the correlation loses its significance before or after the weighted adjustment , the trend may still be useful although its applicability across the literature is taken less assuredly . The weighting function was calculated as follows . For a given CNT category , and for the two material properties in question , the number of data points offered in each contributing paper n was determined and the reciprocal calculated , n −1 . The weight assigned to each data point is then n −1 divided by the sum of every n −1 across all data points being considered . This ensures that the sum of the weights is unity and that the sum of the weights within each paper is equal .

Meunier ( 2020 ) goes on to suggest that social distancing measures have had approximately the same effect as police - enforced home containment policies . When these lockdown measures were implemented , the growth rate of daily deaths in the United Kingdom was at a constant slope . In contrast , the growth rate decreased in France , Italy , and Spain . Vinceti et al . ( 2020 ) collect mobile phone mobility data during the period 1st February 2020 to the 27th March 2020 to investigate the daily positive tests in Italy .

Empirical findings revealed that the presence of income inequalities resulted in lower abandonment rate , which could mirror the behaviour of captive users . Simultaneously , regarding PT trip characteristics , results imply that PT vehicle transfers and waiting time are the two most critical trip segments as per user opinion , for continuing or not using PT modes . Additionally , results confirm our initial hypotheses that : ( a ) in cities with higher pandemic impact ( as per number of deaths ) users were deterred to use PT and ( b ) improved disinfection in vehicles could contribute to sustaining ridership . Based on the empirical findings of the regression model analysis , specific policy implications can be derived . The methodology of this paper aims at identifying the key factors that influenced travel behaviour , in terms of abandonment of PT , during the COVID-19 era . These factors may highlight suitable measures , which can be followed by PT and governmental agencies , towards maintaining PT ridership during pandemic and post - pandemic circumstances . At first , the proper and frequent disinfection of vehicles could enhance the perception of safety to PT users and convince them to select PT . Likewise , changes in the PT network , towards the direction of providing more direct trips , can contribute to limited interaction between passengers and thus minimize the possibility of infection . In the same sense , PT operators should ensure that waiting facilities ( bus stops , metro platforms , etc . ) adhere to the health and safety protocols ( clean surfaces , proper ventilation , etc . ) , in order to build confidence among users that PT is not a hotbed of COVID-19 contraction . Furthermore , in regions with higher income inequalities , operators should expect a comparatively lower decrease in PT ridership and thus , the application of PT preferential treatment measures ( dedicated bus lanes , traffic signal priority , etc . ) ( Pulichino & Coughlin , 2005 ) would increase commercial PT speeds and ultimately improve PT service frequencies so as to address crowding events .",398,54778784_10,2

Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations indicated that the Pt atoms were most probably located at the threefold hollow site on the O 3 -terminated surface of FeO x , which is consistent with experimental data . The DFT calculations also indicated that the high catalytic activity of Pt - SAC/ FeO x correlates with the partially vacant 5d orbitals of the positively charged Pt atoms , which reduce both the CO adsorption energy and the activation barriers for CO oxidation .

This is in part due to the observational inaccessibility of the early universe , but also to the lack of a canonical choice of the inflaton field . Given a fixed choice for the inflaton field , discrepancies with observations would force theorists to elaborate the model , possibly identifying new features of the early universe in the process . At present the choice of inflationary models is too flexible to support this kind of approach .

The fact that ( coarsely speaking ) , for each choice of empirical data , there is one eternal inflation model compatible with it ( with a particular choice of inflaton ) , means that the hypothesis is not straightforwardly falsifiable in its entirety ; it also gives rise to concerns regarding underdetermination : if the empirical data gathered thus far is compatible with many choices of inflaton field , which is the correct one ? However , the lack of present falsifiability of eternal inflation does not amount , to our minds , to a defect in the scientific status of the hypothesis , so long as the research programme relies on empirical data to develop a framework consistent with it , which could potentially in the future be more constrained by further empirical data ( for a similar line of reasoning , see Carroll 2019 ) . 45",314,221477998_13,2

This approach resulted in training 19 different prediction models . From a modeling perspective , it is not a big issue . But having different models for each AACC complicated drawing conclusions about their similarities and differences regarding CO 2 emissions . Focusing on the variables that entered in the anthropogenic CO 2 and nonrenewable CO 2 estimation models as shown in Tables 4 and 6 , it was expected that the inclusion of the levels of CO 2 coming from non - renewable generation would be the key predictor for the 19 anthropogenic models . But the relevance of GDP related variables was also significant and somewhat less predictable . It seems that for those AACC with a quite predictable emission model of nonrenewable CO 2 , GDP and time of the year variables are enough to get an accurate prediction . For those communities with less predictable emissions , several extra variables related to financial products , state agent transactions or service sector levels were   required in addition . It should also be noted that the estimation of non - renewable generation emissions was more challenging , as shown by the increased number of variables required per model . Variables related to energy demand , the number of mortgages or affiliations to the social security become more relevant then . The information coded on those two tables could be of great value when designing emission reduction plans per AACC . Two major difficulties were found : apportioning in monthly figures the yearly amount of CO 2 emissions and the lack of mobility data available in Spain . To cope with the first one , a model to estimate these monthly figures was also developed . Unfortunately , despite the evident influence of traffic related emissions in the global CO 2 emissions , the availability of information about mobility patterns per month and per AACC in Spain was very limited and did not allow us to establish any sensible method of estimating them . Initially , data related to the number of yearly crashes and victims were used as proxy variables for mobility , as there is literature pointing to the existing relationship between exposure and injuries ( Segui - Gomez et al . , 2011 ) . However even if this data is available up to 2018 it did not end up contributing to the significance of the models .

Firstly , only the first branch is modulated to the highest transparency when the other two branches are closed . By changing the voltage on its tail phase shifter ( PS-1 ) , the yellow curve is shown . It denotes the interference result of branch 1 and reference branch . Secondly , keep the voltage on the PS-1 at the constructive interference point ( black circled ) ; modulate the second branch to its highest transparency ; change the second tail phase shifter ( PS-2 ) . The purple curve is recorded . By operating the same process for the third branch , we obtain the green curve is divided evenly . Figure 2d provides the measured splitting ratio of the cascaded DCs , showing an evenness lower than 1.2 dB. At each modulating branch , we fabricate a tail phase shifter to compensate for the phase difference between branches and the reference . More details of chip fabrication and characterization are provided in the Supplementary Section . In the OCDC , stable push - pull modulation is important to keep the constructive interference for photodetection . Figure 2e shows an example result of push - pull modulation ( see "" Methods "" ) . This result is yielded by complementarily changing voltages on the upper and lower arms of a single modulator with other modulators staying static . The amplitude of the output optical field varies along a cosine curve when the applied voltages change . The R 2 of the fitting is 0.9994 , indicating that the push - pull modulation is accomplished with high stability . Then the constructive interference of multiple branches is inspected in Fig . 2f . It is shown that , with proper configuration of the tail phase shifter , the output optical fields of different branches can match in - phase , performing a jointly constructive interference .

Details of the neural network can be found at the ref . 30 . and "" Methods "" . Given that the linear part of FC layers and convolutional layers can be decomposed to dot products ; we can realize these layers by reusing the OCDC temporally .

The decomposition of MVMs is straightforward since they are naturally calculated via vector - vector dot product . The input vector is loaded onto the second row of modulators marked "" slow mod .

At later time intervals of 1 - 2 µs , the DRCN5 T triplet polarisation pattern is harder to ascribe as being either eea / eaa or eaa / eaa ( which would be consistent with an ISC or recombination triplet , respectively ) . Furthermore , the weak trEPR signal at room temperature means only time averaged signals can show clear spectra and this makes observation of the evolution of the triplet harder .

Built environment variables were included in the models in two steps based on relevant theoretical considerations ( Mouratidis & Poortinga , 2020;Naess , 2019 ) . The first step includes the variables "" distance to city center "" and "" neighborhood density "" , while the second step additionally includes the variables "" public transport "" , "" local facilities "" , "" park area "" , "" tree cover "" , "" apartment "" , and "" dwelling size "" all of which might be influenced by distance to city center and neighborhood density . In models of the second step , distance to city center and neighborhood density play the role of control variables . Variables on health and wellbeing that were examined as dependent variables in regression models are : "" life satisfaction "" , "" personal relationships satisfaction "" , "" leisure satisfaction "" , "" overall health "" , "" happiness "" , "" anxiety "" , "" headache "" , and "" back pain "" . The other three health and well - being variables in our dataset were considered less relevant to the built environment so were not included in this analysis in order to reduce complexity . The analysis was conducted for health and well - being : before COVID-19 , during COVID-19 , and for the change before - during COVID-19 . For the dependent variables that decreased during COVID-19 , the change was calculated by subtracting the value of the variable during COVID-19 from the value of the variable before COVID-19 . For the dependent variables that increased during COVID-19 , the change was calculated by subtracting the value of the variable before COVID-19 from the value of the variable during COVID-19 . Independent analyses for the urban regions of Athens and Thessaloniki are presented in each table . All the analyses control for individual sociodemographic variables and area socioeconomic status(their coefficients are not presented here to reduce the size of the tables ) .",679,208356154_62,3

For the analyzer orientations ζ = 0 and ζ = π/2 , we obtain the two normal components of the SHG field , that is , I X ~ c os 2 ( 3θ − 2φ ) , and I Y ~ s in 2 ( 3θ − 2φ ) , respectively . The graphical representation of Equation ( 1 ) at a fixed analyzer position of ζ = 0 and the corresponding visualization in a polar diagram ( Figure 2b ) demonstrates a fourfold symmetry for the SHG intensity that rotates for different armchair orientations θ ( for different armchair angles and choice of ζ = π/2 , see also the polar diagrams in Supplementary Fig . S2 of Supplementary Materials ) . Thus , each armchair orientation corresponds to a characteristic fourfold symmetric polar diagram . Consequently , by fitting pixel - by - pixel the PSHG experimental data to Equation ( 1 ) , we can acquire the armchair angle θ for every pixel of the image . We note that the armchair directions differing by 60 ° produce the same polar diagrams ( that is , the armchair direction can be determined modulo 60 ° ) , reflecting the threefold rotational symmetry of the WS 2 crystal ( that is , the fact that Ultrahigh - resolution nonlinear optical imaging in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides S Psilodimitrakopoulos et al there are three equivalent armchair axes ) . Furthermore , the excitation polarization for φ between 0 ° and 90 ° provides the same PSHG intensity modulation as for φ between 90 ° and 180 ° . This is also the case for φ between 180 ° and 270 ° or 270 ° and 360 ° (fourfold symmetry ) . Therefore , φ sampling in the range 0 ° -90 ° is adequate to retrieve all possible armchair orientations , that is , θ ∈ [ 0 ° -60 ° ] .",352,205260665_9,2

As shown in Table 1 , such data was collected by the ECDPC from 37 OECD countries . However , collection of data was omitted on some dates , in some countries . For comparison of all these variables across countries , the data on both new cases and deaths were standardized to represent incidence per 1 million people . The number tested was standardized to be expressed as the rate of tests per 1000 individuals . 5 In the determinant factor analysis , due to the weak normality of the distribution , we converted the data to the square root values , as explained above . 6 Table 2 shows the changes in the RSV , the key variable of this study , from just before the event week to the mid - point , in the 37 OECD countries we analyzed . In addition , Table 2 shows the dates when the peaks of new cases and deaths existed during the analysis period . In Table 2 , we see that RSV showed rapid changes in many countries around March 11 and March 12 . 17 out of 37 countries ( 45.9 % ) also exhibited their peak immediately following the declaration ( within 2 days ) and 28 out of 37 countries ( 75.7 % ) reached their peak of RSV within a week . These results confirm the likelihood that the WHO 's pandemic declaration had a significant effect on the changes in RSV , while also indicating that there were differences among countries . Table 2 also presents the duration of the analyzed RSV . Duration is defined as the period ( in days ) until the RSV was restored to that of March 10 , a date just preceding the event week . Table 2 also shows significant differences by country : it is notable that Italy , Japan , and Korea , where a large number of confirmed cases had already been reported , experienced a very short duration . The durations presented in Table 2 had a very high correlation with the RSV increase rate in the event week ( Pearson correlation coefficient 0.808 , p - value < 0.000 ) , and this can be confirmed by referring to Fig . 3 . We thus confirmed that the greater the increase in RSV , the longer the duration , and in consideration of multicollinearity , we did not add RSV duration as a variable in our analysis .",433,9520440_1,3

648a47591b9b678478cd03e5,233916124,Journal of Cleaner Production,62,"Since AACC in Spain can implement policies to control CO 2 emissions in their territory , this paper used data retrieved at the AACC level so that the models developed here could be used by the regional authorities to design custom emission regulation policies that could be optimized for their individual characteristics . This approach resulted in training 19 different prediction models . From a modeling perspective , it is not a big issue . But having different models for each AACC complicated drawing conclusions about their similarities and differences regarding CO 2 emissions . Focusing on the variables that entered in the anthropogenic CO 2 and nonrenewable CO 2 estimation models as shown in Tables 4 and 6 , it was expected that the inclusion of the levels of CO 2 coming from non - renewable generation would be the key predictor for the 19 anthropogenic models . But the relevance of GDP related variables was also significant and somewhat less predictable . It seems that for those AACC with a quite predictable emission model of nonrenewable CO 2 , GDP and time of the year variables are enough to get an accurate prediction . For those communities with less predictable emissions , several extra variables related to financial products , state agent transactions or service sector levels were   required in addition . It should also be noted that the estimation of non - renewable generation emissions was more challenging , as shown by the increased number of variables required per model . Variables related to energy demand , the number of mortgages or affiliations to the social security become more relevant then . The information coded on those two tables could be of great value when designing emission reduction plans per AACC . Two major difficulties were found : apportioning in monthly figures the yearly amount of CO 2 emissions and the lack of mobility data available in Spain . To cope with the first one , a model to estimate these monthly figures was also developed . Unfortunately , despite the evident influence of traffic related emissions in the global CO 2 emissions , the availability of information about mobility patterns per month and per AACC in Spain was very limited and did not allow us to establish any sensible method of estimating them . Initially , data related to the number of yearly crashes and victims were used as proxy variables for mobility , as there is literature pointing to the existing relationship between exposure and injuries ( Segui - Gomez et al . , 2011 ) . However even if this data is available up to 2018 it did not end up contributing to the significance of the models . Some local administrations report the actual figures of private and public transportation use , unfortunately the number of informed cities is still too low to include this predictor in the models .",489,7533361_20,2

The model is trained on training datasets using optimization methods . For example , fitting a polynomial on training datasets using steepest descent optimization method , where optimization is carried out to obtain values of prefactors of the polynomial . During the optimization procedure one needs to fix a set of hyperparameters , e.g. , the parameters characterizing a steepest descent process . For this set of hyperparameters , the prediction quality is obtained from comparison of the predictions with the information of the cross validation dataset that is not observed by model during training . Subsequently , by minimizing the error , hyperparameters will be updated and optimized . The relevant final error is then determined from predicting the so - far unused test dataset .

648a3c641b9b67847899a2d2,255826268,Cities,48,"In fact , a global travel preferences ' survey , during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic , indicated a significant shift from public to private and non - motorized passenger transport modes , and highlighted that the likelihood of using PT was comparatively higher for females , non - car owners , and longer trip distances ( Abdullah et al . , 2020 ) . Montero - Lamas et al . analysed bus PT ridership and GIS data in A Coruna , Spain , during the COVID-19 lockdown , and they found that in areas with low - income population , high population densities and important concentrations of hospitals , offices and supermarket facilities , the PT demand was relatively higher ( Montero - Lamas et al . , 2022 ) . In Lisbon , Aparicio et al . compared demand figures between 2019 and 2020 for bus , tram and metro networks and found reductions of up to 80 % , but at stations located in peripheral regions with relatively more low - income users , the decrease was lower ( Aparicio et al . , 2021 ) . The fear of COVID-19 infection and the teleworking opportunities were among the key reasons that explained the significant reduction of PT trip frequency levels ( up to 90 % ) in Gdansk , Poland ( Przybylowski et al . , 2021 ) as well as in Warsaw , Poland , where travellers also emphasized their limited personal security on - board due to the crowding and the non - adherence to the rule of wearing masks ( Kłos - Adamkiewicz & Gutowski , 2022 ) . The crowding of PT vehicles and the possibility of teleworking also explained the decreased PT demand figures in Sicily , Italy , which continued to exist until the last months of the year 2020 ( Basbas et al . , 2021 ) . Across the twenty largest metropoles of the USA , the PT demand decreased between 45 and 80 % during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak , and this decrease was positively correlated with the spread of the disease ( number of cases and deaths ) and the educational level of the users in the respective areas ( Qi et al . , 2021 ) . In Chicago , USA , Hu and Chen estimated an average 72 % drop of rail PT users ( of the "" L "" train system ) during the first wave of the pandemic , with that decline being higher in regions with dominance of white , educated and high - income residents ( Hu & Chen , 2021 ) . Heavy rail PT usage also decreased in Hong Kong , China , both among students and adults , who reduced their rail PT trips by up to 48 % ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . When analyzing the ridership decline of the New York subway during the spring of 2020 , Sy et al . discovered that among essential workers , who are generally associated with lower incomes , the mobility levels were comparatively more increased ( Sy et al . , 2021 ) . A study in Belgium examined the hypothesis that women are disadvantaged in the face of COVID-19 and found that females used PT more to commute or shop ( Assoumou Ella , 2021 ) . A nationwide survey , after the end of the first lockdown in Canada , showed that PT demand remained decreased when compared to the pre - pandemic levels , while certain mitigation measures , such as meticulous cleaning , hand sanitizing and mask - wearing would encourage people to continue using PT modes ( Labonté - Lemoyne et al . , 2020 ) . A survey in Cardiff , UK , showed that PT was among the least preferable modes during the pandemic , due to having the highest perceived risk of infection ( Angell & Potoglou , 2022 ) . In Santiago , Chile , during the first week of the anti - COVID-19 restriction measures , the PT ridership decreased by 30 % -40 % within lower income groups , but among higher income users the drop was > 70 % ( Tirachini & Cats , 2020 ) . Duenas et al . studied passenger demand data for the PT services of Bogota , Colombia , during the first half of the year 2020 , and explained that the users with worse socioeconomic conditions ( e.g. , poverty , informal work ) had comparatively increased mobility levels after the relaxation of the first lockdown measures ( Dueñas et al . , 2021 ) . The greatest reduction of trip frequency and PT demand figures was observed in the wealthier neighbourhoods of Daejeon , South Korea , during the first wave of the pandemic ( Kim et al . , 2021 ) . Though that PT was rated as the most unsafe travel mode before the first COVID-19 lockdown in India , there were no important modal shifts from private to PT modes , possibly due to the lack of other alternatives ( Pawar et al . , 2020 ) . Munawar et al . analysed data from Moovit and other sources for Australia and found that due to the physical distancing rules and the fear of virus transmission by fellow passengers , the PT use was reduced by 80 % in April 2020 ( Munawar et al . , 2021 ) .",923,13809227_11,2

The obtained images of the transmitted wavefronts are presented in Figure 3g-3i . Evidently , the patterns of the wavefronts , as well as their spatial - frequency spectra plotted in Figure 3j-3l   very good agreement with our simulations . The appearance of noise in the phase data at 0.23 THz ( and higher frequencies ) coincides with the diffraction minima due to the finite size of the pinhole aperture . Additional experimental data , including the wavefront images obtained at other frequencies and their comparison with the results of our simulations can be found in Supplementary Information . Although the limited bandwidth of the spatial - frequency filtering might be an issue for some practical applications , this problem could be addressed by employing the so - called double - continuum Fano resonance approach 32 , where the bandwidth of the effect is increased by stacking 2D - chiral versions of the metamaterial ( i.e. ASR structures lacking reflection symmetry ) 33 with adiabatically varied resonance frequency . Unlike the wavevector manipulation performed by the lenses , the demonstrated principle of k - selectivity does not rely on gradient structuring . As a result , metamaterials with strong inter - metamolecular coupling can extract plane - wave components from arbitrary shaped wavefronts . A remote analogue of WSS functionality and the associated ' tunnel vision ' effect might be found in conventional rayoptics systems such as astronomical telescopes : for the same magnification the telescopes with higher f - ratio ( i.e. slower telescopes ) will allow an observer to see stars and nebulas on a much darker background yielding overall higher contrast images . Such telescopes have smaller field of view , which limits the directions of the admitted light rays to those nearly parallel to the axis of the ' tunnel ' ( i.e. telescope ) hence blocking most of the light scattered by the atmosphere and immediate surrounding .",359,247274459_25,1

When studying chiral skyrmions in helimagnets using the same geometry , the skyrmions form a long - range ordered hexagonal lattice , leading to sixfold - symmetric SANS peaks . [ 5 ] In SANS , the magnetic scattering factor F m ( q ) = f motif ( q ) × f lattice ( q ) is the convolution of the form factor of the biskyrmion motif , f motif ( q ) , and their lattice order f lattice ( q ) . [ 29 ] If the biskyrmions are not forming a periodic lattice , e.g. , as in the disordered skyrmion phase hosted in the geometrically frustrated spin liquid material Co 7 Zn 7 Mn 6 , [ 11 ] f lattice ( q ) smears out into an isotropic distribution in the q x -q y plane , while the contribution of f motif ( q ) to F m ( q ) becomes more pronounced . Therefore , the nonlattice state offers a unique opportunity to study the form factor of the biskyrmion motif . [ 30 ] Figure 2o shows the experimental biskyrmion SANS pattern obtained at 0.4 T. First , no diffraction peaks are observed , suggesting that in MnNiGa bulk crystals the biskyrmions are not long - range ordered in the hexagonal plane . Note that in LTEM imaging , owing to the small field - of - view , biskyrmions may form a distorted hexagonal lattice , [ 18][19][20][21][22][23 ] which is not in contradiction to the SANS data . In such a disordered state , a possible scenario is that individual biskyrmions have a random in - plane direction due to spontaneous symmetry breaking . Consequently , there would be no preferred direction of the biskyrmions when averaging over all quasiparticles . In this scenario , the scattering intensity is equally distributed forming a ring .",343,16240611_8,2

We generated p - values corresponding to the null hypothesis that the out - of - sample covariance explained by each component was no greater than zero by applying PPCA in a leave - one - rater - out fashion . Specifically , we iteratively applied PPCA to extract components from the judgments of all but one of the raters and projected the held - out rater 's judgments onto the components . We then assessed the partial Pearson correlation between the component scores derived from each heldout rater 's ratings and those derived from the mean ratings from the other culture , partialing out each previous component .

The argument for this broader lesson draws on Williamson 's picture of knowledgefirst as a paradigm which stacks up well with respect to standard theoretic virtues .

However , the unprecedented situation introduces high uncertainty . Governments find it difficult to form an appropriate macroeconomic policy response to the circumstances faced with because the social impact of the disease is still difficult to foresee ( Mckibbin and Roshen , 2020 ) . Meanwhile , forecasting requires at least minimal stability of the situation . It is illustrated by the current statistics which is different from the economic forecasts published during the early period of Covid-19 ( e. g. Ng , 2020 ) . Today more than ever can it be ascertained that citizens ' health has direct impact on the countries ' economic welfare ( Mckibbin and Roshen , 2020;Lin , Meissner , 2020 ) . However , this connection is ambiguous . Strict policy of disease control is saving lives but at the same time directly influences economic decline ( Eichenbaum et al . , 2020 ) . What is more , the effect of long - term quarantine may cause a hysteresis of economic consequences , e. g. destruction of supply chains which would cause a massive deceleration of the global economy ( Eichenbaum et al , 2020 ) . According to International Monetary Fund ( IMF 2020a ) , the global economy may shrink by 3 percent , which is more than the economic recession observed during the global financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 . Economic recession may put millions of people in long - term poverty ( Suryahadi et al . , 2020 ) . Small businesses will suffer the most , evidence for which already exists . For example , around 50 percent of workers in the USA work in small business , the majority of which are in retail . By executing the disease control policy , drastic measures were put in place due to which , during the first months of Covid-19 , around 43 % of the sector 's businesses were temporary closed while the employee busyness has decreased by around 40 % ( Bartik et al . , 2020a ) . Similar tendencies are also observed in Europe and the UK . Countries which implemented a strict "" stay - at - home "" policy and left employees at home with only a part of their pay also observed an increased number of unemployed people , especially in small businesses and among those with least income ( Forsythe et al . , 2020 ) as well as increase in income inequality . This is the main aspect by which Covid-19 crisis differs from the earlier economic crisis , when mostly large - scale production , construction and similar businesses stopped while the most impacted were those with the highest income ( Bartik et al . , 2020;Campello et al . , 2020 ) . Nevertheless , it is difficult to objectively evaluate the situation due to contradicting data . For example , job loss statistics are relatively improved by the fact that a part of employees retired early . Due to this reason , higher number of people quitting their jobs rather than becoming unemployed is observed .",544,232168418_1,2

These challenges are ( A ) the role of the algorithms on the visibility of different posts , ( B ) the non - independence of likes and shares , and ( C ) problems to infer causal effects . Regarding challenge ( A ) , the Facebook algorithms cause prominent posts with a higher number of reactions to be promoted more among observers than posts with lower number of reactions .

The adsorption on the QCM sensor is accompanied by the change in frequency ( Δf ) , while the change in energy dissipation ( ΔD ) provides information on the softness of the adsorbed layer . The formation of high - quality SLB was confirmed by frequency shift of Δf = −24 ± 1 Hz ( Figure 5 ) , which is in agreement with data reported previously . [ 36,37,42 ] The binding of SAv to SLB yielded a frequency shift of Δf = −25 ± 1 Hz ( Figure 5 , black curve ) , which corresponds to the maximum coverage of the surface with SAv . [ 42][43][44 ] After the formation of the SAv - SLB in PBS buffer , the solvent was switched to Milli - Q water to accommodate the introduction of the water solution of the 1 - 2 tubes . This liquid phase exchange is characterized by the increase in frequency and decrease in dissipation followed by the fast stabilization of the signal . After washing with water for 10 min , the solutions of tubes were introduced into the QCM chambers . www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com A solution of 1 ( 500 × 10 −6 m ) did not yield any frequency shift ( Figure 5a ) , confirming that in the absence of biotins in the structure , the tubes do not bind to the SLB .

Furthermore , owing to accessible biotin groups remaining at the outside layer of the 1 - 2 tubes , the attachment of a next layer of SAv on the tubes layer was accomplished ( Figure 5c ) . Fiber - like patterns observed in fluorescent microscopy images ( Figure 5d ) confirmed the specific binding of 1 - 2 tubes to SAv - SLB .

However , the level of detail at which this information is captured varies significantly between the various workflow frameworks , and as a consequence , also the reproducibility level that the framework can actually guarantee . A crucial element in capturing the complete workflow is the proper description of the utilized software . Separating the standalone software packages wrapped in the framework still is a challenge due to the software version , the underlying platform , compiler settings , and other factors that might influence the computation result and compatibility with the workflow framework itself . In KNIME , for instance , workflow templates link to a specific version of a node . If newer versions for a node are available , the old nodes will be marked as deprecated but still part of the workflow template , and the user has to decide whether to use the newer version of the node . Similarly , calculation nodes in AiiDA always have an input node in the provenance graph , representing the actual executable and machine where the code was run and thus allowing to trace back the code that was used and its run environment . Another solution to the issue is to use software encapsulated in a virtual machine or Docker containers , which make execution independent of the platform where it is run . We expect that a broader support for efficient code containerization also in the context of HPC simulations , and their adoption in major HPC centers , will help to effectively address this issue in the next few years .

If the conviction that robots may mitigate the risk of contagion has already created additional incentives for firms to increase the use of robots , this generates a serious reverse causality problem that is absent in analyses ( like ours ) using pre - COVID-19 data . Moreover , as both the epidemic and the conviction that robotization may help reduce the risk of contagion are global phenomena , the foreign stocks of robots might stop being good instruments because in the future all countries will increase robot adoption due to similar contagion - related concerns . Hence , the use of data from 2020 onwards may both lead to greater endogeneity issues due to reverse causality problems , and also invalidate the instrumental variables adopted in works based on data from the pre - COVID-19 period .",518,207966691_27,2

These findings expand the attentional role of the oculomotor system to the internal space of memory and carry relevant implications for the study as well as our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which our brains flexibly prioritise information in memory to serve adaptive behaviour . van   In the domain of perception , the deployment of spatial attention has previously been shown to increase the propensity of small fixational gaze shifts ( microsaccades ) in the direction of covertly attended locations outside of current fixation27,28 that may be critical for attentional facilitation to occur29 . This has been interpreted as an inadvertent spillover effect17,27 from activating oculomotor brain areas ( such as the Frontal Eye Field and Superior Colliculus ) that are recruited for both spatial attention and gaze . In the context of perception , however , it remains possible that such gaze behaviour reflects the sub - threshold consequence of the urge to look at the attended ( or expected ) item when explicitly instructed not to do so . Here , we demonstrate a similar gaze bias within the context of visual working memory , where there was nothing to look at ( nor expected ) in the direction of the bias . These data therefore not only imply a role for the oculomotor system in focusing attention within the internal space of memory , but also show that such oculomotor engagement leaves peripheral traces ( 17 for discussion of such ' peripheral traces ' ) even when there is no incentive for them .",304,232037748_11,2

All TA spectra feature a negative signal of Gaussian shape around 750 nm . This band is consistent with published data and has been attributed to ground state bleaching ( GSB ) as a consequence of the population of band edge states by charge carriers 66,67 . We note that in the case of SnO 2 QDs , the GSB signal exhibits a smaller full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) . Since the GSB originates from charge filling of band edge states , its width is related to the charge distribution profile 67 . In fact , a narrower FWHM indicates less imperfections , such as defects or traps , which in turn leads to a higher V oc 68 . In addition , SnO 2 QDs / perovskite also exhibit a blue - shifted GSB ( ~3 nm ) compared to the other two samples . This is attributed to an optimized degree of order ( the same underlying mechanism leading to a narrower FWHM of GSB ) and accordingly the suppression of non - radiative centers , as revealed from the decay kinetics in Fig . 4o . Since the GSB originates from the population of bandedge states by charge carriers , investigating decay dynamics provides insight to the underlying charge recombination mechanisms . Here , we find that all decays can be described by single exponential functions with lifetimes of 112.3 ± 2.5 , 227.3 ± 2.5 , and 405.1 ± 4.6 ns ,   respectively . In view of the proposed mechanism 69 , we thus assign the recombination to be of first - order . Considering the weak excitonic binding energy in these perovskite materials , we can further assign the first - order recombination to trap - assisted recombination , that is , Shockley - Read - Hall ( SRH ) recombination . Hence , the increased lifetime indicates that the trap density is the highest in the c - SnO 2 sample , and decreases in the commercial SnO 2 NPs sample , and is the lowest in the ligand - assisted SnO 2 QDs sample . The observation of a decreasing trap density implies that multifunctional terminal groups in the SnO 2 can effectively passivate the interface and improve the film quality , both of which contribute to the solar cell performance . These findings consistently explain the alleviated ( or negligible ) hysteresis and enhanced V OC in the SnO 2 QDs - based device , which are further supported by 2D GIWAXS patterns , ELQE , and spatial confocal PL microscopy as discussed above .",502,4830217_16,2

Towards the goal of combining techniques to unleash the creativity of chemists and engineers in order to solve technologyrelevant interfacial phenomena , large - scale research initiatives such as BATTERY 2030 + are uniquely positioned . [ 217 ] Indeed , they offer an unprecedented opportunity to bring together battery specialists with physicists , data scientists , and engineers , with the common objective of fostering novel approaches fundamental to mastering battery interfaces . Evidently , no single research entity currently gathers all the required competencies at the highest level and , rather than competing in a sterile manner , large research consortiums allow for the consolidation of previously disparate knowledge , thus providing shared tools needed for researchers to thrive and express their creativity . To develop such a transformative approach , an initial maturation step is crucially required , during which the scientific infrastructure is created and benchmarked on the next generation of Li - ion batteries , for which the bottlenecks have been clearly identified ( e.g. , stabilization of Si - containing anode materials and high - potential/ high - capacity Ni - rich and/or Mn - rich layered oxides ) . More problematic and challenging chemistries such as Na - ion , multivalent chemistries , Li - S , solid state or aqueous batteries will then benefit from the development of chemistry - agnostic tools and their integration into a systematic , combinatorial approach . Toward this end , community - wide efforts in which data - driven science serves as a guideline for chemists to develop novel electrolytes or active materials are critical .

[ 12 ] Previous scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) investigations of cycled silicon electrodes have likewise failed to detect any significant cracking of the composite electrode or loss of the active material . [ 24 ] It is also not clear why volume expansion effects would give rise to the diffusion - controlled capacity loss effect described in Section 2.2 , especially as the influence of the volume expansion effects should have been very small during the open circuit pauses used in this experiment . The experimental data discussed in Section 2.1 are likewise difficult to explain based on the volume expansion hypothesis as different results were obtained with the same type of silicon electrodes using two different cycling protocols only differing with respect to an additional controlled voltage delithiation step applied on every 10th cycle . The HAXPES results also indicate that no highly lithiated phases remained in the surface region of the electrode after the delithiation step , which could suggest that parts of the electrode material had been made electrochemically inactive during the cycling . Due to abovementioned points , it can be concluded that a loss of active material due to volume expansion effects is very unlikely to be the main reason for the observed capacity losses .",250,17140284_2,2

The dashed line in Figure 4 represents a fit with a fixed slope of unity to the data E g , opt = E g , SWV − ( 0.44 ± 0.02 ) [ eV ] . For most DPP polymers , the optical and electrochemical band gaps adhere to this relation ( R 2 = 0.72 ) , but exceptions are evident , especially for 2PyDTP ( 8) and to lesser extent for 2Py3 T ( 6 ) , 5 T ( 15 ) , TDTPT ( 18 ) , and SDTPS ( 19 ) . If we view E g , SWV as the single - particle gap ( sometimes called the transport gap ) , the dashed line in Figure 4 indicates that the effective singlet exciton binding energy is ≈0.44 eV , quite independent of the specific polymer ( apart from the exceptions noted ) . The average effective binding energy , determined empirically as E b = E g , SWV − E g , opt , amounts to 0.44 eV and reflects a combination of fundamental effects ( such as Coulomb and exchange interactions ) and experimental effects ( such as the presence of electrolyte ions in the oxidized or reduced films that may affect the absolute and relative values of the redox potentials ) . We also note that the actual E b value will depend on how the optical and electrochemical gaps are determined . We used the onsets of the absorbance spectrum and the square - wave voltammogram as determined by the crossing of tangent in the inflection point and the baseline . Hence , the value should be treated with caution . The value of the singlet exciton binding energy in semiconducting polymers has been subject to intense discussions , as it has been notoriously difficult to agree on the method how it can be determined experimentally . Many - body theoretical calculations of the excitonic properties of conjugated polymers that include the interchain screening of the Coulomb interaction by using the bulk dielectric constant have revealed binding energies of 0.4 - 0.6 eV for a number of homopolymers , [ 48 ] consistent with the present result for donor - acceptor DPP polymers . For smallmolecule organic semiconductors , the singlet exciton binding energy is often much larger . [ 37,[49][50][51 ] It is of interest to consider why polymers 2PyDTP ( 8)     holds for two other polymers that have an electron - rich DTP unit , i.e. , TDTPT ( 18 ) and SDTPS ( 19 ) , but for which the thienophene-2,5 - diyl and selenophen-2 - yl units that flank the DPP unit are more electron rich that the pyridine-2,6 - diyl unit in 2PyDTP ( 8) . For 2Py3 T ( 6 ) , the lower E b = 0.31 eV is a result of the combination of an electron - deficient 2Py - DPP-2Py segment as in 8 with an electron - rich 3 T ( terthiophene ) segment . 3 T is more electron rich than 1 T and 2 T units in 2PyT ( 1 ) and 2Py2 T ( 2 ) , but less than DTP in 2PyDTP ( 8) . Finally , 5 T ( 15 ) has the longest electron - rich segment , combined with DPP , in which case the centers of positive and negative charge densities of a CT - like absorption are more spatially separated . In summary , the effective binding energy for the DPP polymers defined as E b = E g , SWV − E g , opt amounts to about 0.44 eV for most DPP polymers , but can be significantly smaller when electronically distinct units are alternating along the chain .",704,248858409_43,2

This model is mainly for stationary non - white noise sequence data , and generally uses a specific mathematical formula to make the data meet the calculation conditions ( Morimune and Miyazaki , 1997 ) . In the process of transforming a non - stationary time series into a stationary time series , the ARIMA model is a model established by regressing the dependent variable only on its lag value and the present value and lag value of the random error term . This reflects that the ARIMA model has the characteristics of simple operation . Its modeling only needs endogenous variables and does not need to resort to other exogenous variables . At the same time , the ARIMA model also has its application limitations . First of all , the model has strict requirements on the stability of the data . Stationarity can be divided into two categories : strong stability and weak stability . In the process of practical application , strong stationarity is too ideal and theoretical , and weak stationarity and unevenness need to be dealt with by difference tools .

Therefore , any missing information in measurements directly deteriorates the final reconstruction . However , the LT - SSNP is an iterative reconstruction scheme . The iterative reconstruction begins with an initial guess ( usually based on the Rytov approximation ) , and the initial solution is updated based on the calculated error gradient by using the forward model . In addition , prior knowledge about the sample is imposed on the current guess during the iterative process . Therefore , even if the measurements are underdetermined due to missing measurements , the learning approaches can fill in some of the missing information . This idea was validated by reducing the number of illumination angles used for each method . The experimental data used for this investigation were ODT images of a pair of HCT116 human colon cancer cells . These cancerous epithelial cells contain information in small structures relative to the size of the cell and highlight the importance of reconstructions that can capture these fine details . Reconstructions were performed by using Rytov , linear tomography 20 , and the LT - SSNP by using different numbers of projection angles ( 45 , 24 , 12 , and 4 ) uniformly spaced in the range from 0 to 360 ° . The linear tomography method uses the same iterative reconstruction scheme as the LT - SSNP , except with single scattering as the forward model . For the quantitative analysis , we also compare the structural similarity index ( SSIM ) 33 for reconstructions from compressed measurements with the full measurement case , namely , 360 angles at the focal plane . The results , plotted in Fig . 7 , show a dramatic improvement in the reconstruction quality for linear tomography and the LT - SSNP because the two methods iteratively fill up empty components introduced from missing measurements but using different forward models . In the case of the HCT116 cells , Rytov produces fairly good reconstructions that reveal intracellular structures with 360 full projections , despite the underestimation due to the missing - cone problem . The Rytov reconstructions , on the other hand , rapidly deteriorate as the number of illumination angles decreases . Compared with Rytov and linear tomography , the LT - SSNP is more robust in the number of projections , providing reconstructions with only four scanning angles with nearly the same quality as reconstructions by using the full 360 - angle data , as confirmed by the SSIM in Fig .   7b . We believe that the LT - SSNP can benefit from both the iterative scheme and an accurate forward model . In addition , we further tested the compression using the cell phantom , which has higher RI contrasts ; the results have been added to the supplementary material .",497,29531779_8,3

According to these authors , certain scientific methods , when applied to phenomena that are not even tentatively understood , can represent instances of what they call ' agnostic science ' . One paradigmatic example of such a method that might be agnostic in this sense , is machine learning . A comparison of two usages of machine learning , the PageRank algorithm and the microarray method , illustrates how it can be applied to both , phenomena that are understood and those that are not . Napoletani and his co - authors argue that the PageRank algorithm , which provides a hierarchical classification of websites , represents a way of applying a machine learning algorithm to a well - understood problem that possesses a foreseeable solutionstructure ; because the result of this application is an increased understanding of the problem and its solution , this usage does not count as an example of agnostic science . Conversely , the microarray method , which classifies messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) molecules according to their function as co - occurrent with specific diseases , involves the application of machine learning to a problem that is known to exist , but for which we lack any insight regarding its structure and for which predicting an outcome is infeasible ; as Napoletani et al . ( 2021 , p. 45 ) argue , "" [ the ] mechanism that leads from a certain distribution of mRNA molecules to the manifestation of a certain disease is [ … ] rarely understood . In addition , it is also unclear which specific mRNA molecules are relevant in particular diseases "" . Consequently , although it provides us with meaningful correlations , the microarray method does not increase our understanding of the problem and its solution - structure is not transparent . That is , ' agnostic science ' according to Napoletani et al . refers to whether we gain any understanding of a phenomenon when applying big data and machine learning methods in science , while Anderson 's notion of ' agnostic science ' is that these methods can be applied without any prior expert knowledge or theory .

Billed as the streamer 's response to the success of HBO 's Game of Thrones ( 2011 - 2019 ) , the show was savaged by American television critics who found it to be a ' disappointment ' and ' dramatically inert ' ( Genzlinger , 2014;Van Der Werff , 2014 ) . A month after Marco Polo 's premier and just 2 weeks after the second season renewal was announced , CEO Reed Hastings told an interviewer the show was ' a massive success ' that had ' been super popular with the audience ' ( Stenovec , 2015 ) . The second season , with a budget of more than 100 million dollars , premiered in July 2016 .

648a3a111b9b6784788b7f29,255060743,Synthese,14,"The existing literature on aggregating evidence for causal hypotheses accords well with the witness schema . One might interpret the key questions as follows : How should individual ' witness reports ' be delineated to ( at least approximately ) preserve independence and how should the reliability of these reports be assessed ? What algorithm should be employed for aggregating the reported causal conclusions ? Consider an example report amounting to a statistical reject / accept result concerning some causal claim . This is effectively a witness report that has some degree of reliability . Indeed , there is a preoccupation in the literature ( in particular , the ' hierarchy of evidence ' literature associated with the ' evidence - based medicine / policy ' movement ; see Brendan et al . 2014 for an overview ) with how to assess the reliability of study results given the design in question ( the sample size , the controls for bias , etc . ) , and furthermore with how to aggregate the results , for instance , whether supposedly more reliable study types should ' trump ' others or whether they should all play a role in determining the final causal conclusions . 5 Most evidence hierarchies place statistical meta - analyses near the top . 6 One might worry that the witness model does not account for this kind of conglomerate evidence , where the effect size measures from different studies ( perhaps the difference in efficacy of two treatments ) are combined in sophisticated ways . By way of response : There are two ways one might reconcile statistical meta - analysis with the witness schema . The first is to see meta - analysis as an instance of the general schema , with a particular choice of algorithm for aggregating the witness reports , and limited to a certain kind 4 In the Bayesian setting , the witness reports are mere indicators of the truth . 5 For instance , the hierarchy introduced by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE 2006 ) places meta - analyses , systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) , and RCTs above case - control or cohort studies , non - analytical studies such as case reports , and expert opinion . In addition to worries about undue privileging of RCTS , a major criticism of the evidence hierarchies is that mechanistic evidence and expert opinion are distinguished from correlational evidence and relegated to the bottom of the hierarchy ( see Brendan et al . 2014 ) . The claim is that mechanistic evidence for causation is rather complementary to statistical evidence ( see the Russo - Williamson thesis , Russo and Williamson 2007 ) . This criticism does not necessarily undermine the witness schema . Instead , one can draw a lesson of caution from this debate regarding what counts as independent witness - style evidence . In particular , one might contend that evidence of mechanisms and evidence of probabilistic - association can not be treated as separate ' witnesses ' . 6 As per the NICE hierarchy ( see previous footnote ) . of evidence ( generally the fine - grained effect - size results of RCTs ) . 7 The second is to treat an individual meta - analysis as itself a single study or witness report , perhaps a very reliable one if it is based on considerable data from multiple experiments ( but see Stegenga 2011 for doubts about the reliability of meta - analyses ) . The latter route is attractive because in practice there are many meta - analyses at hand that account for some , but not all , of the raw statistical data that could serve as potential input for assessing a causal hypothesis . 8 In general , the above discussion underscores a point made above , namely that the witness schema , while offering some useful constraints , is nonetheless a very flexible model for evidence aggregation . Clearly a lot depends on how the evidence is divided into independent witnesses and assessed for reliability . That is , it is apparent that a lot of the difficult questions in negotiating evidence are shifted to the ' pre - processing ' of the evidence , and away from the final aggregation task . So , the general dictates of logic - here spelled out in terms of a witness model - can provide a basic framework for evidence aggregation , but further substantial aspects of the process are inevitably left unspecified . That is not to say that these further details of identifying , weighing and aggregating evidence can not in large part be automated via an explicit algorithm . How much automation is a good idea is of course the question that remains unanswered .",815,5765580_45,2

So , by limiting the sustainability analysis to metals , Lithium has dramatically high SRS , comparable to Cobalt that is worldwide known as a Critical Raw Material ( CRM ) . [ 39 ] The factors that negatively impact on the SRS score of Lithium are the recycling , the global supply concentration , and the substitutability , being the latter identified as a major bottleneck also for other metals . With respect of recycling issues , a literature survey offered very different scenarios , [ 40 ] pointing out the importance of a critical Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) analysis of lithium ( and related technologies ) before drawing any definitive conclusion . The only critical score for sodium is the recycling that , however , could not be considered as a real hotspot due to its large availability ( 2.36 % in the Earth Crust ) ; on the other hand , Al has negative scores only with respect to substitutability . [ 41 ] The environmental impact of different metals was thoroughly investigated recently by means of different metrics such as Cumulative Energy Demand ( CED ) , Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) , and Yearly Global CO 2 Emission ( YGCE ) . [ 42 ] On one hand , CED measures the total energy usage during the whole life cycle of a given material and it includes both the direct and indirect energy usage ( also associated with material consumption ) ; [ 43 ] on the other , GWP is the heat absorbed as CO 2 equivalent by any greenhouse gas generated throughout the production process ( from mining to end - of - life / recycling ) and delivered in the atmosphere . Of course , when dealing with metals , these indicators strongly depend on the final utilization of the materials and they are expected to change if large scale use is proposed . Having Lithium as a reference ( CED = 125 MJ kg −1 , GWP = 7.1 kg CO 2 -eq / kg and IGCE = 3.07 kg CO 2 -eq / kg ) , the other metals under scrutiny for new batteries , generally have milder values : Mg , Zn , and Ca have very low CED ( 18 , 52.9 , and 5.8 MJ kg −1 , respectively ) GWP ( 5.4 , 3.1 , and 1.0 kg CO 2 -eq / kg , respectively ) and YGCE ( 1.05 and 0.98 kg CO 2 -eq / kg , for Mg and Ca respectively ) . Zinc , on the other hand , has comparable YGCE values to Li . Quite unexpectedly , Al has slightly higher values for all the metrics , CED = 131 MJ kg −1 , GWP = 8.2 kg CO 2 -eq / kg and IGCE = 9.47 kg CO 2 -eq / kg ) . Of course , these values are referred to the production of pure metals starting from naturally available sources and they could be meaningfully downsized by considering appropriate recycling and end - of - life use . Based on these , the most promising candidate to replace Li is Ca . Similar data on alkaline metals ( such as Na and K ) are still missing , thus the comparison is incomplete . This lack of available data is further pointing toward the necessity of a comprehensive analyses of different materials in the coming future .",659,10136520_21,2

The literature on the measures of the pandemic 's evolution presents some consensual proxies , namely mortality ( Zeylke and Bauchner , 2020 ) , newly confirmed cases ( Ashraf , 2020;Zhang et al . , 2020 ) , and excess deaths ( Woolf et al . , 2020 ) . This latter proxy has been criticized as it might be a biased estimation . Therefore , we retain , in our analysis , two proxies to measure the pandemic 's evolution : the daily growth in deaths related to COVID-19 ( hereafter , GD t ) and the daily growth in confirmed cases ( GC t ) , measured as the relative growth rate of the cumulative sum of deaths and cases between day ( t ) and day ( t − 1 ) , respectively .

648a47591b9b678478ccf392,228984842,Journal of Cleaner Production,23,"Since mono - digestion of broiler manure is impractical due to the high nitrogen and dry matter content it was assumed that the manure is transported to a close by biogas plant , where it is codigested without any prestorage together with wetter feedstock ( e.g. liquid cow manure ) and feedstocks with a higher C / N ratio ( e.g. energy crops ) . However , since the focus was on the impacts associated with the broiler manure , these feedstocks were not modelled explicitly . Emissions from biogas plant operation were derived similar to the methodology and data of Effenberger et al . ( 2016 ) . Biogas was assumed to be used in a cogeneration unit with pilot injection engine to produce heat and electricity . The energy generation was calculated from the CH 4 production in the digester ( and the poststorage in the case of a closed storage ) , and with an electrical efficiency of the CHP of 38 % and thermal efficiency of 44 % . Electricity produced was assumed to replace energy generation according to the German energy mix , and thus negatively accounted with a carbon intensity of 0.588 kg CO 2eq per kWh , while for the energy consumed by the biogas plant a factor of 0.615 kg CO 2eq per kWh ( Moro and Lonza , 2018 ) was used . These values account for upstream emissions from extraction , refining and transport , as well as for trade between countries and losses in the grid . 40 % of the generated heat were assumed to be used externally , which is in line with the current situation in the German state of Lower Saxony ( Kralemann et al . , 2018 ) , to replace heating with natural gas . For the substituted natural gas use , losses of CH 4 of 2.3 % during production and transmission were also accounted for ( Alvarez et al . , 2018 ) . For the construction of the biogas plant an emission factor of 0.015 kg CO 2eq per kWh electrical energy production was assumed , ignition oil consumption was considered with 3.75 kg / h and engine oil usage with 0.0004 kg / kWh ( Effenberger et al . , 2016 ) . CH 4 was assumed to leak from the digester , the closed post - storage tank and the CHP unit ( 1 % of the produced gas at each stage ) . Furthermore , NO x emissions from the CHP were considered with 1000 mg / m 3 exhaust gas ( Aschmann et al . , 2007 ) . Liebetrau et al . ( 2010 ) showed that the methane emissions from the co - generation unit can range quite significantly between 0.17 and 3.72 % . The sensitivity analysis considered these two variants in addition to the default value of 1 % . Also considered was a variant of open digestate storage , and one where the share of thermal energy use was reduced to 0 % .",513,256060110_24,2

The determined capacitance values are shown in Table 2 . The specific capacity is shown to be inversely proportional to the scan rate , which is due to ions , at lower scan rates , penetrating   Table 2 also shows a comparison of the unmodified G / AME , and MoO 2 -G / AMEs clearly demonstrating the electrochemical decoration improve the capacitance . GCD tests can also be used to evaluate the performance of the supercapacitors , these being the preferred method for DC testing . The GCD process is measured by the responsive potential with respect to time unlike CV , which evaluates data correlating with electrochemical phenomena arising at the electrode / electrolyte interface . The GCD measurement is completed in two steps : 1 ) a constant current charges a supercapacitor first , and then 2 ) the supercapacitor is discharged in a specific voltage range or charge / discharge time . Capacitive analysis of GCD was performed using a symmetrical two - electrode approach , such as the one described above ( an electrode spacing of 5 mm was utilized ) . Figure 2B shows three charge / discharge cycles of the G / AME again , utilizing the −1.4 V deposition potential held for 300 and 600 s to produce the G / AME - MoO 2 . The capacitance of the systems was calculated using Equation ( 1 ) where the well - documented correlation between current and capacitance is again observed , as shown in Figure 2C , D where high currents are observed to reduce the capacitance . In this case , the reduction is significant and results in an order of magnitude change in the performance , this is largely due to the filler quantity of the electrode and the relatively high resistance having a significant impact on the performance at the higher currents . Of note , Figure 2C shows the comparison of the G / AME with that of different electrochemical modification strategies ( potential and time ) where the MoO 2 -G / AMEs prepared by −1.4 V , 600 s give rise to the optimal capacitive response . Last , Figure 2D compares the    Table 2 where significant improvements are observed when using ionic liquids over that of conventional aqueous media . The inspection of Table 1 shows that the improved capacitance in ionic liquid is due to the wider electrochemical window that is not possible in the aqueous media . The capacitance output of the MoO 2 -G/ AMEs is compared to prior literature which demonstrates an excellent performance of 1212 F g -1 ( @1.48 A g -1 ) . Note that the various electrolyte and cell configurations do not allow direct comparisons to be feasibly made . Furthermore , the capacitive stability was explored via 1000 GCD cycles , with the resultant plots being shown in Figure 3 . It can be seen that the consistency of performance of the devices remains , in the most part , over 80 % , with the one exception being the MoO 2 modification at −1.4 V for 300 s , indicating there is a potentially less direct binding to the surface , and the MoO 2 is liberated from the surface during testing . It should be noted that all electrodes perform similarly to the unmodified G / AMEs , indicating that there is no inherent loss in cycling reliability after the surface modification is made . Overall , the optimal electrochemical decoration in terms of capacitive output and stability is clearly the electrochemical decoration of MoO 2 using a potential of −1.4 V held at 600 s.",695,232201390_12,3

648a441f1b9b678478ba19b5,104323766,Advanced Energy Materials,21,"Experimental studies also do not provide a completely consistent insight . In a recent experimental study on the energy alignment at pentacene / C 60 interfaces , it was shown that the HOMO - LUMO gap at the interface varies from 1.50 eV for a face - on orientation to 0.75 eV for an edge - on arrangement of the molecules . [ 62 ] This is consistent with earlier work in which it was shown that interface energies of sexithiophene depend on the orientation of the molecules with respect to the interface . [ 63 ] On the other hand , the HOMO - LUMO gap at the interface between diindenoperylene and C 60 was found to be identical to that based on the HOMO and LUMO energies of the pristine materials . [ 54 ] In their review , Koch and coworkers conclude that predicting the interface dipole is difficult , [ 23 ] but from a more recent study on blends of five commonly used conjugated polymers with PCBM one can infer that the vacuum level shift scales with E HOMO , D . [ 7 ] The vacuum level shift ( Δ ) and E HOMO , D from ref . [ 7 ] are collected in Table S2 and Figure S6 in the Supporting Information . A fit gives Δ = ( 0.33 ± 0.09)E HOMO , D + ( 1.76 ± 0.43 ) [ eV ] . Although the number of data points ( 5 ) is limited and the correlation ( R 2 = 0.88 ) is not perfect , the vacuum level shift indeed decreases with more negative E HOMO , D . Because Δ increases the offset between E HOMO , D and E LUMO , A at the donor - acceptor interface , it increases the V oc for donors with a low oxidation potential . In fact , when the slope of 0.33 is added to the slope of 0.75 found in our work , a total slope of 1.08 emerges , which is ( probably somewhat fortuitously ) identical to the slope of 1.08 recently found by Vandewal and coworkers between qV oc and E CT . [ 10 ] In summary , both theoretical and experimental studies suggest that different molecular orientations can give rise to differences in E CT at the donor - acceptor interface , amounting up to several tenths of an electron volt . While such deviations can explain the difference between a slope of 0.75 and a slope of 1 , over the ≈1 eV range of HOMO energies ( Figure 2 ) , they do not give a rationale for the result that V oc ( and hence E CT ) would change in gradual fashion with the HOMO energy , which is suggested by the small scatter ( < 0.1 eV ) in the experimental data with respect to the fit ( Figure 2 ) . Possibly , the formation of an interface dipole at the DPP polymer - PCBM interface , [ 23 ] which one can expect to be dependent on the HOMO level of the donor , explains the slope of less than 1 found in a plot of V oc versus E ox .

In Hup , four is hi - bab'ní , whose etymology is analysed by Epps as "" ( fact)have.sibling / accompany.nmlz .

In Yuhup , four is bab - ní - w'ǎp , whose etymology is analysed by Epps as "" has - sibling - quantity .

This article uses frame analysis , a method that has made a substantial contribution to our understanding of election coverage , to look at the way the 2014 Scottish referendum on independence from the United Kingdom was represented in a range of Scottish newspapers . Drawing from the analysis of the specific case and reflecting on previous studies of campaigns on other topics and national contexts , it addresses the following question : did the press coverage of the referendum generate different frames compared to those of election campaigns , as would be justified by the different nature of these political events ? The findings have implications both for our understanding of referendums as mediated events and for evaluating the performance of the news media in explaining what a referendum is about . This latter is particularly significant because the media are for most people a key source of information on politics , and how they define referendums matters ( Wettstein , 2012 ) . Despite the dramatic decline of the print press internationally and in Scotland specifically ( Dekavalla , 2015 ) , it remains a significant part of the ' relay race ' of discourses in the public sphere ( Garton et al . , 1991 : 100 - 103 ) , whereby print , broadcast and online media co - create the mediated public debate and re - represent political discourse on different platforms . The 2014 referendum has been hailed as an occasion where grassroots groups reinvigorated the debate on social media and challenged the dominance of traditional news platforms ( Law , 2015 ) , but these accounts also recognize that the press and broadcasting remained important ' in setting the parameters of official political discourse as well as registering the ways in which social media replicate the established patterns of political discourse as much as it threatens to dislodge them ' ( Law , 2015 : 7 ) . Newspapers may have had a relatively restricted print readership , but they were read by political elites and by contributors to broadcast and online media , they often became themselves direct or indirect contributors to online conversations , while the material dominating the debate on ' old ' media was also the main material for discussion on social media ( Paterson , 2015 : 23 ) . For this reason , newspapers are worth studying , as they remain a component of this multiplatform debate . A discussion , however , of how newspaper coverage was interpreted and used by other parts of the public sphere , or by voters in their decision - making process , would require a wider range of data , and the influence of the coverage on the outcome of the referendum falls outside the scope of this article .",515,14640018_17,2

' ' Freeman ( 1994 ) describes stakeholder theory as '' one of many ways to blend together the central concepts of business with those of ethics . Rather than take each concept of business singly or the whole of '' business '' together and hold it to the light of ethical standards , we can use the stakeholder concept to create more fine - grained analyses that combine business and ethics ( … ) '' ( p. 409 ) . In fact , our findings suggest that respondents belonging to different stakeholder networks , such as business groups and community groups , share a common sense that using purely legal or economic reasoning will often lead to neglecting aspects related to social or ethical concerns . In fact , from a stakeholder viewpoint , there is no evidence in the findings of this study that a differentiation between different types of business responsibilities is useful or supported . On the contrary , such an approach seems to anger respondents particularly form a community perspective and is also seen as '' out of date '' and unhelpful by many business respondents . As such , theories in CSR and ethics lag behind this much more holistic view of business evidenced in the findings of this study by holding on to a legal or regulatory debate in the CSR literature ( Mackey et al . 2007;Mueckenberger and Jastram 2010;Russo and Perrini 2010;Svendsen and Laberge 2001 ) . Interestingly , this call for more integrated management theory corresponds with a debate in the management literature on the purpose of business ( Alexander and Douthit 2016;Hsieh 2015;Nichols 2014 ) as well as with reviews in CSR and ethics literature on the holistic nature of stakeholder expectations ( Aguinis and Glavas 2012;Gond et al . 2011;Liston - Heyes and Ceton 2009;Lucea 2010;Matten and Moon 2008;Orlitzky et al . 2015 ) . Our study starts to integrate aspects that can be seen to relate to legal , economic , ethical , and social aspects of business by presenting a process , outlined in Fig . 1 and discussed in the managerial implications below , that is developed from our empirical data to form a stakeholder perspective .

648a3a111b9b6784788b98aa,237459907,Synthese,5,"In these models the social influence inherent in the network structure means that groups tend towards consensus . Typically enough actors gather data about the best option that the entire group eventually ends up accurately believing that it is , indeed , best . But in many versions of these models communities can also fail to form a good consensus . Zollman assumes that actors in his models myopically choose whichever option they currently believe is most successful . This might correspond to a gambler playing the bandit arm she likes best , or a scientist generally testing the theory they find most promising , or a doctor prescribing only the medication she thinks most efficacious . In some cases , a string of misleading data can lead an entire community to prefer a suboptimal option . Once the entire group focuses on this option , they stop testing other ones and settle on a poor consensus . Zollman ( 2010 ) gives a case study exemplifying this latter possibility . In the early 20th century , scientists debated whether stomach acid or bacteria was the primary cause of peptic ulcer disease . A highly influential study by Palmer ( 1954 ) convinced the research community that bacteria could not live in the stomach , resulting in a consensus on the acid theory . This research was flawed , but was only finally overturned by the work of Warren and Marshall ( 1983 ) .",245,118493321_12,2

The cooling crystal temperature ( T x ) initially drops rapidly with the slope given by ≈ −η c ( T c ) P abs ( T c ) /C x ( T x ) before the radiative load ( from the chamber ) and conductive load ( through the link ) slow down this process , as shown in Figure 7a . The coldfinger , however , initially experiences a small temperature increase due to the small fluorescence leakage β l at a rate given by ≈β l η ext P abs ( T c ) /C f ( T c ) before cooling from the crystal reverses this process in a time scale approximated by τ ≈ K l ( T c ) /C l ( T c ) , as shown in Figure 7b . Beyond this point , both the crystal and cold - finger continue to cool and reach the steadystate condition with a temperature difference ðT f À T x Þ final % 2P link load = K l ðT l Þ , where P link load denotes the total heat load power ( parasitic and useful ) carried through the link . The data used in Figure 7 and the corresponding fits were obtained for N rt = 1 ( one laser roundtrip ) . The parameters obtained from these fits are β l ≈0.2 % , η c ( T c ) ≈1.2 % at λ=1020 nm ( corresponding to η ext ≈0.992 ) , α b ≈2.1×10 −4 cm −1 , and ϵ x % ϵ l % 0:38 . The values for η ext and α b are in close agreement with previously measured values for this 10 % Yb 3 + -doped YLF crystal . β l also agrees with the calculated value from the raytracing model . T c was fixed at 283.15 K , which is the final measured temperature of the clamshell . With the above parameters fixed , the model predicts a final coldfinger temperature T f = 135.0 K with a temperature drop of ΔT = T f −T x = 6.8 K across the link when the number of roundtrips is increased to N rt ≥30 , as expected in the Herriott cell arrangement . Considering the simplicity of our model , these calculated values are in excellent agreement with our observed values of T f = 134.9 K and ΔT = 6.1 K ( Fig . 6a ) . The above calculations assumed a negligible heat lift ( P lift = 0 mW ) in comparison to the existing radiative and fluorescence loads . Furthermore , the measured initial slope of 0.31 K / mW ( Fig . 6b ) is in good agreement with ∂T f /∂P lift ≈ 0.31 K / mW obtained from the model calculations . In a final experiment , the laser - cooled HgCdTe sensor was used as part of an FTIR spectrometer and the infrared absorption spectrum of a sheet of low - density poly - ethylene ( LDPE ) was measured ( Fig . 8) . This is the first demonstration of a sensor cooled by solid - state optical refrigeration used as part of a practical device . Figure 8 shows the absorbance spectrum of the same sample measured with an equivalent HgCdTe sensor cooled with liquid nitrogen to 77 K. The bandgap energy E g = hc / λ of this HgCdTe sensor corresponds to a cutoff wavelength of λ = 16.7 µm . The primary noise source is due to statistical fluctuations of the thermally activated dark current within the detector element . The dark current I d is proportional to the number of carriers that are thermally excited across the bandgap and thus varies approximately as I d ∝exp ( −E g /k B T f ) , with the corresponding noise amplitude varying as ffiffiffiffi I d p",681,17807230_23,2

Energy is indispensable for the functioning of the global economic system ( Haider and Adil Masudul , 2019;Mahmood and Ahmad , 2018 ) . Many production and consumption activities use energy as a necessary input . At the same time , economic growth may lead to more energy consumption ( Lee and Chang , 2005;Wang and Zhang , 2020 ) .

The illuminating power on the cornea was measured to be 0.8 mW , which is within the ANSI laser safety standard ( Supplementary laser safety standard calculation ) . Briefly , we used a free - space interferometry configuration to minimize the dispersion , where the probing beam was collimated and split by a cube beam splitter into the reference and sample arms . The beam in the sample arm was steered by a pair of galvanometer mirrors to scan the focal point across the retina . The two beams from the reference and sample arms recombined at the beam splitter and were collected by an optical fiber . The fiber delivered the light to a home - made spectrometer that collected the interference spectral fringes by a line - scan CCD camera ( spl2k , Basler ) . The full - width - halfmaximum ( FWHM ) of the spectral coverage was ∼85 nm , giving us 1.7 - μm axial resolution . The lateral resolution was estimated to be 15 μm in the retina . Two scanning protocols were performed . Protocol 1 raster - scanned a 20 ° squared retinal area with 256 × 256 pixels in each direction at a 25 kHz A - line rate . Protocol 2 used dual circle scanning that scanned two concentric circles centered at the optic disk with 4096 pixels in each circle at a 70 kHz A - line rate . The dual circle scan pattern was repeated eight times and the results were averaged to remove motion artifacts and pulsatile flow pattern .

648a444b1b9b678478bae256,52131320,Light-Science & Applications,12,"Briefly , a 532 - nm nanosecond - pulsed fiber laser beam was coupled to a single mode optical fiber . A 1310 - nm continuous diode laser with a 40 μm coherence length was used to interrogate the reflected light from the sample with a spot that was co - focused with the excitation beam . The collimated interrogation beam passed through a polarized beam splitter ( VBA05 - 1550 , Newton , New Jersey , USA ) to direct vertically polarized light through a λ/4 zero - order wave plate ( Thorlabs Inc. , Newton , NJ , USA ) into a beam combiner ( BC ) . Then , it was scanned across the samples via a 2D galvanometer scanning mirror system ( GVS012 / M , Thorlabs , Inc. ) along with the excitation beam . The scanning mirrors were driven by a two - channel function generator ( AFG3022B , Tektronix Inc. , Beaverton , OR , USA ) . The scanning light was then focused tightly using a 0.4 - numerical - aperture objective lens ( M Plan Apo NIR 20X , Mitutoyo , Kawasaki - shi , Japan ) . The light reflected back through the wave plate was converted from circular to horizontal polarization and then reflected at the polarizing beam - splitter interface , directing the maximum possible intensity of reflected light to a 150 - MHz bandwidth InGaAs photodiode ( PDA10CF , Thorlabs , Inc. ) . The output of the photodiode was amplified using an RF amplifier ( 5900PR , Olympus , Center Valley , PA , USA ) with a band pass filter ( 1 - 50 MHz ) and 26 dB gain and then digitized using a four - channel , 12 - bit PCI digitizer ( CSE1242 , Gage Applied , Lockport , IL , USA ) at a sampling rate of 200 million samples per second . A two - axis mechanical scanning system was used for imaging larger fields - of - view . Photoacoustic remote sensing P Hajireza et al lateral sample movement down to a 1.25 μm step size , while maintaining scanning mirrors in a fixed position . The scanning region size was limited by the onboard capture card memory , though multiple captures or data streaming could be implemented to extend the imaging range to the full reach of the motor stages . Images which were captured using the galvanometer scanning mirror system used fixed fast and slow scanning rates of 65 and 0.25 Hz , respectively . Large field of view images were formed using 2axis mechanical scanning and were performed with a 2.5 μm step size at a 2.5 KHz acquisition rate . For example , to produce a 4 × 4 mm scan , roughly 17 min were required . The pulse repetition rate of the excitation laser was fixed at 40 KHz for all of the images shown in the manuscript . Figure 3a demonstrates PARS imaging of~7 μm carbon fiber networks at~1 mm depth in water . This depth is significantly greater than the 40 μm coherence length of the probe beam , such that any local optical interferometry of reflected light between the target and surface signals was rejected . This large field of view image was captured using~1 nJ excitation pulse energy and~4 mW interrogation power on the sample using the mechanical scanning method Photoacoustic remote sensing P Hajireza et al explained in the previous section . The signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) , defined as the average of the maximum amplitude projection pixels in a region of interest over the standard deviation of the noise , was quantified as 60 ± 3 dB. A representative PARS signal as a function of time is shown in Figure 3b . This was acquired by imaging a single carbon fiber at a depth of approximately 0.25 mm in a 20 % intralipid scattering medium ( reduced scattering coefficient of~10 cm − 1 at 532 nm wavelengths , similar to previous work 43 ) . The photoacoustic signals were recorded coincident with the laser excitation pulse . Only a 75 ns time delay between PA signals and excitation laser pulses was observed , which is consistent with the group delay of the analog filters of the RF amplifier . When a carbon fiber target was positioned at different depths below a water surface , no additional time - of - flight was measured . This demonstrated that signals were associated with initial pressures rather than propagation - delayed surface oscillations . Such signals were only present when an absorbing target was imaged , eliminating concerns of pump - beam contamination in the photodiode signal . More information about time - of - flight measurements is given in Supplementary Information , Section 2 . In addition , to demonstrate that PARS image contrast was due to transient modulations associated with excitation pulse absorption and not inherent scattering , a set of experiments were performed as shown in the Supplementary Information , Section 3 . Figure 3c demonstrates the power spectral density of PARS signals from a single 7 μm carbon fiber placed at 0.25 mm depth in a 20 % intralipid scattering medium . The − 3 dB ( blue line ) and − 6 dB ( green line ) bandwidth are measured as 54 and 65 MHz , respectively . These measurements were acquired without an amplifier and with only a 25 KHz analog high - pass filter and a 1 MHz digital high - pass filter . Representative time domain signals are shown in Supplementary   Figure 1b . Fourteen hundred A - scan signals from the carbon fiber were averaged for the bandwidth calculation . These time domain signals were windowed with a 300 ns length hamming function around the signal and then zero padded to 200 samples , prior to conversion to frequency domain .",997,235549357_73,2

No such peak can , however , be seen in these HAXPES spectra in Figure 4 . While this could indicate that the Li z Si concentration , within the about 30 nm thick surface region probed in the HAXPES measurements , was too low after the 6.25 - hour delithiation step , this explanation is unlikely since the spectra were recorded about seven days after the delithiation experiment . There should consequently have been sufficient time for lithium to diffuse from the internal parts of the electrode to the ( delithiated ) electrode surface . However , as this would generate a surface region in which all the probed silicon atoms had analogous lithium environments only one photoemission peak should be seen , in good agreement with the experimental results . The small shift in the Li x Si peak toward lower binding energies with increasing cycle number hence constitute additional support for an increased lithium concentration in the delithiated electrodes .",213,236294095_126,2

In principle , a coherent system is capable of retrieving both the amplitude and the phase information of optical signals , however at the price of a relative sensitivity to the phase noise of the transmitter and local oscillator 46 . In order to maintain a stable heterodyne detection , narrow linewidth semiconductor lasers are required 47 . At 40 Gbit/ s , the required linewidth is to be of 240 kHz , 120 kHz , and 112 kHz for 16PSK , 16QAM , and 64QAM , respectively 48 . Apart from the coherent technology , low noise oscillators are also needed for optical atomic clocks , frequency synthesis , high - resolution spectroscopy and distributed sensing systems [ 49][50][51][52 ] . In such applications , it is important to use semiconductor lasers featuring both low frequency noise ( FN ) and relative intensity noise ( RIN ) 53 . Indeed , the RIN degrades the signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) and the biterror rate ( BER ) hence affecting the performance of a high - speed communication system 54,55 . Although a low RIN floor can certainly be achieved by increasing the bias current of the laser source , it goes with an unwanted extra energy consumption . In radar applications , the RIN has also to be closed to that of the shot noise level over a bandwidth ranging up to 20 GHz hence showing the importance of generating coherent states of light for low - noise oscillators 56 . To meet these goals , QD and QDash lasers are strong candidates because they feature a low population inversion factor and reduced amplified spontaneous emission ( ASE ) noise 57 .",306,231700942_14,2

Using the experimental value of E red , SWV = −0.98 V versus Fc / Fc + and Fc / Fc E + = −4.59 eV , we find a E LUMO , SWV = −3.61 eV for PC 61 BM , which is in fair agreement with value of −(3.84 ± 0.04 ) eV found by Yoshida . [ 52 ] Of course , UPS and SWV are not expected to yield in all cases the same value of the HOMO energy . Most importantly , the ionization energies probed are electrostatically screened to different extents , due to the different local environments in which the ionized molecules reside . In UPS , the signal originates predominantly from molecules at the surface , where the screening due to the polarizability of the environment is weaker than that in the bulk . [ 30 ] The signal as probed by voltammetry of molecules in solution is influenced by the screening by the metal electrode and by the electrolyte solution . [ 36 ] In the case of voltammetry on thin films , it is not well known to what extent the ionization process takes place at the outer film surface , in contact with the electrolyte , or in the bulk of the thin film . In any case , also the presence of the electrolyte and the metal electrode will affect the redox potential . Additional complications include 1 ) the effect of the vacuum surface or the interface with the electrolyte on the energetic disorder , 2 ) the different roles of molecular relaxation during the excitation , and 3 ) the different roles of possible surface or bulk contaminants . These effects may also depend on the specific material properties .",603,119004188_12,2

However , the two types of SEM ( covariance - based , or CB - SEM , and variance - based , or VB - SEM ) have certain prerequisites related to data , as discussed in recent studies ( e.g. Luqman et al . , 2021 ) . For instance , CB - SEM has certain sample size requirements . In addition , the sample must not include outliers , and the data should be linear , normally distributed , homoscedastic and free from multicollinearity . While VB-   SEM has more relaxed sample - related requirements , it also requires the data to be linear and possess other multivariate characteristics ( Hew et al . , 2019;Talwar , Talwar , Tarjanne et al . , 2021 ) . Consequently , scholars suggest using an ANN approach for data that exhibit both linear and non - linear associations and deviate from other multivariate characteristics mentioned above ( e.g. Leong et al . , 2020 ; . ANN is an artificial intelligence and machine - learning based approach that uses input , hidden and output neurons to generate output in terms of the influence of antecedents on outcome variables . The network of neurons is trained with new information to conduct analysis and generate output . The training process is driven by a two - way ( i.e. forward and backward ) information flow . Multiple rounds of the training process help to minimise errors . In the current study , we applied ANN by dividing the available data into training and testing data to generate output in terms of the relative importance of each proposed antecedent . We used the root mean square error ( RMSE ) values of various models to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions .",330,11455225_2,2

648a3a111b9b6784788ba019,36385693,Synthese,24,"Opacity problems generate mismatched communication and uncertainty in interactions between collaborators which make it very difficult to coordinate practices in productive ways . In other cases the problems might be less directly due to a lack of technical insight into one another 's practices and more due to the fact that the conceptual and methodological distance between the cognitive domains is very large . As mentioned philosophers often identify such divides , and sometimes propose ways , in theory at least , to bridge them . However sometimes there might be no straightforward way to translate or link models or concepts from the different domains , without solving very complex problems neither domain is well - adapted to solve with its current sets of practices . Importantly it may require significantly restructuring practices in those domains in ways which conflict with the way practices in those domains have been designed and optimized . In such cases domain specificity becomes a particularly intransigent obstacle . One particular such problem in economics / ecology collaborations is the problem of scale . Most experimental work and models in ecology are of relatively small scale compared to those in economics ( working over limited spatial regions , with limited numbers of variables ) . This fits the range at which experimentation can be manageably carried out , and thus the range over which reliable models can be produced . Such models can guide individual land - use decisions , such as harvesting strategies for resource management . On the other hand economics usually works with larger - scale models relevant for regional , national or international policy formation built using observational data ( Vermaat et al . 2005 ) . It at these levels that there is a demand for policy relevant contributions from ecology to economic models . Unfortunately there are no simple reliable ways of scaling up models produced in one limited context to another larger context . As Stevens et al . ( 2007 ) put it , scaling up requires the addition of assumptions that introduce further error , while requiring complex arguments that reduce "" the transparency of results and makes them difficult to explain to non - specialists ( Carpenter 1998 ) "" . On the other hand scaling up experiments to a large - scale is not only an enormously expensive option but such experiments become difficult to control and replicate . Arguably ecology has settled on its scales of experimentation and model - building because they fit well these practical and epistemic constraints . There is no easy pathway to transforming the field . The result however is that ecological models and economic models are for the most part not in scale alignment , and thus lack conceptual compatibility . There is likely no easy way to resolve this incompatibility . 9 At certain scales of economic analysis economics and ecology can be in temporal and spatial scale alignment . For example in the field of resource management and harvesting for individual land or resource users , such problems connecting model variables can be much more straightforward . However even here conceptual problems of these kinds may arise ( MacLeod and Nagatsu 2016 ) . For instance economic optimization readily requires growth models that are valid outside the physical situations used to build the model . Optimization algorithms survey factual as well as counterfactual possibilities . However this requires a usually larger range of validity than most models in the domain of resource management are usually constructed to achieve . Most are built using statistical regression techniques , and are valid only for the domain encompassed by the data used in their construction . In ecology the models that can provide better reliability are called process - based models . Process - based models attempt to model the causal processes underlying ecological growth . This enables reliable model predictions outside the range of data used to build the models and over longer time - scales , both essential factors in economic optimization . However such models require considerably more work and expertise ( particularly computational and biological expertise ) to produce requiring longer time frames . Knowledge in particular of the relevant processes which determine a system 's response to future climate conditions is "" extremely limited "" and difficult to produce ( Cuddington et al . 2013 , p. 9 ) .",737,248814946_142,2

This makes the choices about how to address this problem especially important . The authors applied only one technique and therefore could not provide sensitivity analyses that would , in my view , provide a more robust understanding of the data . The claims they make about the effectiveness of their SSI are strong and bold , which puts more pressure on them to show that their effects are robust ( or not ) when applying different techniques to handle their missing data . The approach they chose - multiple imputation of all participants who were randomized - may artificially inflate the power of their tests . Of the 2452 participants who were randomized , 398 did not complete their condition , and 686 did not complete the follow - up measure . ( It is unclear to me if this 686 figure includes the 398 who did not finish their condition , or if it means that 686 of those who finished their condition did not complete the follow - up measure ) . Regardless , it appears that about 25 - 45 % of the sample either a ) did not complete their intervention , b ) did not fill out their follow - up measure , or c ) both . When rates of missing data are this high , the technique(s ) used to address missing data can meaningfully change a study 's findings and the way that those findings are interpreted . The authors implemented the Amelia II algorithm in R to impute missing data . Although they state that this approach is more conservative than other approaches , such as listwise deletion and last - observation - carried - forward analyses , this is true only under certain conditions . Those conditions may have obtained in this dataset , but there is no way to know this from what they report . Many multiple imputation approaches take the pattern that is observed in the available data and essentially apply that pattern of findings to the missing data . This is partially why these approaches are only considered valid if there is reason to believe -or evidence in support of -a claim that the data are Missing at Random . Missingness in the present dataset are extremely unlikely to have resulted from random processes . In particular , rates of dropout across the conditions differed substantially ( from 10 % in ABC to 20 % in Personality ) and significantly ( per a chi square test ) . The authors should address this limitation . Possibilities include implementing at least two alternative approaches to missing outcome data , such as :",472,52131428_10,2

That is , studies vary according to the source of information where ( in)consistent information is provided from . On the one hand , companies provide CSR information , but inconsistencies arise as the information on a same or similar issue ( e.g. , CSR ) provides differing or even contradicting signals . For instance , there could be an imbalance between the extent companies pursue external versus internal CSR initiatives ( Scheidler et al . , 2019 ) or a ( mis ) fit between pre - versus post - crisis CSR initiatives ( Kim & Choi , 2018 ) . In these cases , previous results indicate that inconsistencies are detrimental to stakeholder reactions ( e.gKim & Choi , 2018;Scheidler et al . , 2019 ) . On the other hand , inconsistencies may result from different information provided by different source , for instance , when the company communicates about its CSR initiatives in a different way than third parties do or objective data is showing ( e.g. , Nyilasy et al . , 2014;Skard & Thorbjørnsen , 2014 ) .

It can be expected that both false positives ( i.e. , posts misclassified as containing CSR content ) and false negatives ( i.e. , failures to identify true CSR posts ) exist . From a measurement theory viewpoint , these misclassifications represent random measurement error which downward biases the effect sizes . As our effect sizes were not only significant but also substantial , the download bias was apparently not so substantial that it led to the inability to find effects . On the contrary , it can be expected that because of the error , true effect sizes are even larger . As a future research implication , we suggest the application of modern forms of supervised text mining algorithms ( Foster et al . , 2016 ) not only to enhance a most accurate classification but also to estimate the amount of accuracy versus measurement error .",217,3458362_17,2

648a441f1b9b678478ba1fa7,199648051,Advanced Energy Materials,18,"The electrochemical and elemental analysis data strongly indicate that silicon electrodes suffer from capacity losses due to diffusion controlled lithium trapping and that the imbalance between the lithiation and delithiation charges is further increased by continuous SEI formation required to maintain a constant thickness of the SEI layer . Although it is generally difficult to detect the trapped lithium using delithiated electrodes that only have been cycled for a few cycles , it should be possible to detect the trapped lithium at later stages in an extended cycling experiment . Figure 4 shows hard X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy S1s spectra for a pristine silicon electrode as well as a silicon electrode analyzed after the lithiation and delithiation steps on the first , 25th and 50th cycles , respectively ( the latter electrode was cycled using the standard constant cycling protocol discussed in Section 2.1 ) . For the pristine electrode , two distinct peaks were observed due to the presence of silicon oxide and bulk Si , respectively . After the first lithiation , a new peak due to the Li - Si alloy emerged at lower binding energies ( see the yellow Li z Si peak in Figure 4 ) in addition to the silicon peak . In the spectra for the cycled electrode , the silicon peak was denoted Li x Si to indicate that the electrode also contained some residual lithium yielding a shift toward lower binding energies . [ 23 ] The latter shift should , incidentally , be coupled to the shift in the redox potential of the electrode to lower potentials expected for an increasing lithium concentration in the electrode ( see Section 2.1 ) . After 25 and 50 cycles , the Li - Si alloy peak had clearly increased in size , indicating a build - up of residual lithium at the electrode surface that should not be present in the absence of the lithium - trapping effect . The latter is very important , as this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first HAXPES evidence for the lithium - trapping effect . By comparing the positions of the peaks in Figure 4 with those reported in our previous work involving step - by - step lithiation of silicon , [ 23 ] it can be seen that the spectra for the 25th cycle match those previously obtained using a lithiation capacity of Adv . Energy Mater . 2019 , 9,1901608   2000 mAh g −1 . In addition , the spectra for the 50th cycle suggest a lithiation degree corresponding to a lithiation capacity between 2000 and 4000 mAh g −1 . Here it should be noted that the experimental data indicate that the silicon electrode should have had a total capacity ( i.e. , lithiation capacity + accumulated capacity loss ) of 2055 and 2463 mAh g −1 after 25 and 50 cycles , respectively .

Common aim of all these technologies under development is to understand what induces changes foremost in the electrical properties of the PV devices but also to the mechanical , the physical and chemical properties of the various layers and interfaces under ambient factors such as light , temperature , humidity and oxygen . This is done with a combination of electrical , optical , morphological , mechanical and chemicallysensitive techniques and associated modelling . Compared to OPV , the perovskite fi eld is still in its infancy , [ 15 ] but many considerations of the OPV can be applied to this new fi eld . There are signifi ca nt differences , though . Most notable is the chemical stability of the perovskite [ 16 ] which can decompose into PbI 2 and/or other components which are detrimental to the stability of output power . The photoactive layer is susceptible to moisture , oxygen , UV light and temperature with water being a major culprit for catalyzing decomposition . [ 17 ] Whereas perovskite devices do not typically contain a photoactive blend system as used in OPV , the morphological and crystalline structure of the perovskite layer [ 18 ] does play a huge role in the performance and stability of these devices . The top hole conductor also has a strong bearing on performance both at the cell level [ 19 ] and at the module level . [ 20 ] Perovskite solar cells can be found in two main architectures that both deliver high effi ciencies : with and without a mesoporous scaffold ( typically made of titania or alumina ) . Early signs [ 21 ] show that the presence of a mesoporous or nanostructured scaffold maz have a signifi ca nt positive effect on device stability both at the cell [ 22 ] and module level . [ 23 ] Furthermore , perovskites have been shown to suffer from measurement induced hysteresis , [ 24 ] which needs also to be considered when designing measurement and stability protocols for this type of device . Recently , outdoor fi eld data have also been reported [ 25 ] on hole - conductor - free PSCs based on a triple - layer architecture employing carbon as a back contact as well as heat exposure for 3 months at 80 - 85 ° C , which are encouraging . [ 26 ] Dye solar cells [ 27 ] are electrochemical devices , so the differences regarding stability are even more substantial . [ 28 ] The glaring one is the presence of a liquid electrolyte . It needs to be contained inside the cell chamber , which puts an onus on effective encapsulation , which not only needs to keep oxygen and moisture out since these can cause chemical changes to the electrolyte together with UV light [ 29 ] and the dye or its detachment , which makes hydrophobic dyes more stable , [ 30 ] but also keep the corrosive electrolyte from seeping out ( this limits the current sustaining capabilities of the cells and can corrode the silver contacts of a module ) . Thus , effective encapsulants and barriers are required together with electrolytes with high boiling point solvents [ 31 ] and stabilizing additives . [ 32 ] The task is more severe when developing devices on fl exible substrates . [ 33 ] Solid or quasi solid state DSSCs with polymeric hole transporters or gel electrolytes have also been developed to increase stability . [ 34 ] Electrochemical reactions occurring in reverse biased dye solar cells [ 35 ] ( as would happen to a shaded cell in a module ) can also lead to device failure if severe .

Given that the cost people pay for them ( retail price : CNY 7 per mask ) is quite low relative to disposable masks ( retail price : CNY 0.35 per medical and surgical mask and CNY 2.5 per KN95 ) , we developed an evaluation model based on the number of washes in Section 2.4.2 to reduce the uncertainty associated with low settings for the number of washes .",205,6252358_87,2

In particular , if it turns out to be right that the main determinant of the mass / count distinction is vagueness , then the interface of grammar with the conceptual system has to be somewhat reassessed . Under the view that Universal Grammar ( UG ) is , essentially , a lexicon together with a recursive computational apparatus , vagueness would n't just play a role at lexical interfaces with extralinguistic systems , but it would shape some aspects of the computational apparatus itself . More specifically it would have a rather direct and perhaps surprising impact on the morphosyntax of number . Another way to put it is that the non lexical component of UG ( unlike other conceivable computational devices ) is pre - wired to handle vagueness ; if one views UG as the structure of a ' language organ ' , one can readily speculate on why a computational system that is capable of handling efficiently vague information would be a better fit with our environment that a system that is n't . 1 I will be taking the notion of vagueness pretty much as given and adopt a ' supervaluation ' approach to it , 2 in the particular version developed by Veltman ( 1985 ) , also known as ' data semantics ' . In adapting to my goals a supervaluationist approach , I will try to remain neutral between ' indeterministic ' vs. ' epistemic ' stands on vagueness , even though my own bias towards the former may sometimes seep through . 3 I also wo n't have anything to say on issues pertaining to higher order vagueness .",294,231654013_20,2

The two case studies are representative of the reasons why data researchers obtain inconsistent results . The disagreement between Cornaglia ( 2006 , 2013 ) and Abrevaya and Puzzello ( 2012 ) results from different but plausible methodological decisions . Hence , one is unable to resolve the controversy by arguing that one of the two inconsistent results is an effect of using inappropriate ( from the perspective of statistical methodology ) statistical techniques what implies that an additional source of evidence is required for the resolution . Furthermore , the discussion of economic models representing addicts ' decision process shows that mechanistic evidence can also be divided , i.e. , economists can disagree in regard to which of a few hypothesized mechanisms actually produces the phenomenon . It allows for drawing a lesson that the quality of mechanistic evidence needs to be carefully assessed . Considering that the sources of mechanistic evidence in economics and medicine are different , the case study is a good ground for discussing approaches to evaluating the quality of mechanistic evidence stemming from mathematical models .

First , we tested on different machine learning models , including Naïve Bayes , Logistic Regression , Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) , and Long Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) , and tried different text representation such as bag - ofwords and pre - trained word vectors . Secondly , we applied the optimal LSTM model on the collected Tweets and analyzed the sentiment change of different cities across time . Finally , we used Spearman 's rank correlation to investigate the relationship between Tweet sentiment , quarantine measures , and COVID-19 statistics such as new case emerges , hospitalization , and deaths in three cities - New York City , Los Angeles , and London , where we collected sufficient and quality Tweets to drive the machine learning based sentiment analysis . Since Tweet sentiments and the spread of the pandemic may vary by city , a comparative study across cities could allow researchers to incorporate city - specific features , such as the demographic distribution , economic indexes , and accessibility of public transportation , to dig deeper into the reasons behind the possible correlations found . Also , as pandemic quarantine measures could have huge impacts on the daily life of residents , such policies are often issued on a city , or even district level . Thus , a city - bycity comparison could help policymakers better distinguish the response of different residents and design more differentiated measures to prevent the spread of epidemics . The rest of the article was structured into the following sections . Section 2 ( Literature review ) reviews relevant research related to sentiment analysis and Twitter data usage . Section 3 ( Method ) introduces the methodology for Tweet collection , data preprocessing , machine learning classifiers for sentiment analysis , and the ranking rule for Spearman 's correlation . Section 4 ( Results ) presents the data summary and correlation analysis . Section 5 ( Discussion ) explores how the results of this study could be interpreted considering the difference in population density and infrastructure across cities .

The purpose of using these instruments is to capture the exogenous technological differences across industries that lead to different uses of robots in the production process . We chose Japan and South Korea because they have among the highest robot adoption rates , provide reliable and readily available data on employment by industry , and are not part of the European Union and so less likely to be influenced by factors shaping robot adoption in Italy as well .

[ 48 ] While lithium and cobalt are both largely concentrated in South America and the DRC , respectively , companies located in China are largely responsible for the refinement of these raw materials for battery material production . [ 68,69 ] China has significantly increased investment into cobalt mining activities overseas in order to provide a domestic and steady downstream supply of raw materials . Chinese dominance of both raw and battery materials may lead to supply shortages if critical materials are leveraged in diplomatic disputes or reserved for their domestic use . [ 69 ] Therefore , country - level disruption to South American countries , the DRC or China could result in a significant impact on global lithium and cobalt supply resulting in high supply risk . [ 48 ] In addition to lithium and cobalt , environmental policies appearing throughout South East Asia banning raw ore exports or suspending nickel extraction in certain regions may pose a notable risk to nickel supply . [ 70 ] Increased insight into the environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) impacts of critical metal mining ( see Environmental , Social and Governance Impacts Section ) has led to increased consciousness toward responsible sourcing , which may further restrict resources available for use . Tesla has demonstrated the need for a secure supply chain by securing the supply of both Ni and Li as these metals pose the greatest risk within their nickel - rich chemistries . [ 47,70 ] Helbig et al . attempted to quantify the supply risk associated with a selection of metals used for battery applications . [ 72 ] From this study , it was determined that Li and Co posed the most significant supply risk ( 54 % risk ) . Risk to Li supply was largely impacted by lack of sufficient recycling opportunities , whereas high Co risk was a result of political instability and byproduct dependence . From the data presented , Ni ( 50 % ) and Mn ( 52 % ) show similar supply risk scores , with Ni risk largely dependent on supply reduction . Mn , on the other hand , shows a high score , despite its high natural abundance , due to its lack of substitutability . Ti was also evaluated , due to its use in lithium titanate anode materials ( Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ) , and was shown to have a lower supply risk ( 43 % ) .

The operational energy density of the prototype device , based on the electrical energy generated from the discharge data in Figure 5 normalized by the mass of the stored reactants , is estimated to be 32 Wh kg −1 . This value compares favorably to other recently reported biodegradable batteries , [ 7,8 ] albeit further improvements are needed to reach the level of conventional primary batteries such as Li - ion batteries . An important advantage of the present device configuration , in terms of energy density , is that the reactants are stored in the dry , solid state . Compared to an equivalent redox flow battery with the same reactants stored in liquid electrolytes , the operational energy density is ≈7× higher . This feature is particularly important for the portable applications intended for the battery . Figure S2 ( Supporting Information ) shows the Coulombic electroactive material utilization calculated from the discharge curves of the battery prototypes in Figure 5 as the fraction of active species converted by the battery during discharge until the cut - off voltage ( in this case 0.5 V ) is reached . The batteries with an intermediate absorbent pad thickness operated under a high load show the highest active material utilization among the tested conditions . Interestingly , under these conditions , the device with internally stored reactants achieves a higher utilization ( 13.3 % ) than the corresponding device supplied with premixed reactant solutions ( 8.9 % ) , which could be due to reactions already taking place in the dissolved active species before coming into the battery . This indicates yet another advantage of the proposed PowerPAD flow battery configuration with onboard reactant storage in terms of reactant utilization , although further optimization is required to fully exploit its potential in this regard .",337,202746201_7,2

In the current article , we moved beyond the question whether participants in general use forward induction reasoning and instead first explored two ways of segregating the participants into groups to see whether and how they can be divided into reasonable "" player types "" . The first way to construct a typology was based on latent class analysis , which turned out to divide the players into three classes according to their first decisions in the game : Random players , Learners , and finally Expected players who make decisions consistent with forward induction . This typology appeared to be reasonable , because the three levels correspond with increasing gains in the games and with increasing time spent on decisions . The second way of constructing a typology was based on the participants ' answers to a question about their opponent , classified according to levels of theory of mind : the resulting types are Zero - order , First - order and Second - order . This typology was also validated by increasing levels of theory of mind turning out to correspond to increasing monetary awards and increasing decision times .

It is also common to utilize a three electrode system , introducing both a simple counter and reference electrode , as opposed to a second complex ' active ' ( e.g. , a metal oxide based cathode ) electrode , despite the fact that this will exclude any influence of the redox processes at this electrode on the electrochemical environment . The complex working electrode itself is also commonly replaced with a relatively flat analogue , highly unrepresentative of most battery electrodes , but often deemed necessary due to the perceived vertical height limitations with AFM . Finally , although many other differences exist on a case - by - case basis , it is usual to utilize a vast excess of electrolyte in these studies , in comparison to the ' lean ' electrolyte conditions in many modern batteries , necessary to fully submerge all the electrodes and the probe . These simplified conditions are beneficial for expanding our understanding of the basic mechanisms occurring during battery electrochemical processes , in particular at the electrode / electrolyte interface ( pseudo 2D ) . However , it excludes contributions from more complex phenomena in 3D , such as electrode strain , electric field distribution , the nature of the conductive network and ionic transportation and more , all of which we must understand to help improve batteries . Hence it is essential that the data collected to date is critically appraised , considering the degree to which it can truly be used to expand our understanding of processes within real batteries .",343,233844642_21,2

Reusable cotton masks are discarded after 6 days of use ; in other words , they can withstand up to 5 washes while maintaining their protective properties , as recommended by the surveyed factories . Despite the fact that there are many different brands of reusable masks on the market that may vary in the maximum numbers of washes ( TESTEX Community Mask Label , 2022 ) , with some reportedly able to withstand up to 30 washes ( Forever Family , 2022 ) , due to limited research conditions and survey funding , production data were only available for masks that could be washed up to 5 times . Given that the cost people pay for them ( retail price : CNY 7 per mask ) is quite low relative to disposable masks ( retail price : CNY 0.35 per medical and surgical mask and CNY 2.5 per KN95 ) , we developed an evaluation model based on the number of washes in Section 2.4.2 to reduce the uncertainty associated with low settings for the number of washes .",205,233025194_2,2

The association between these figures with our global cities sample is explored using two indicators developed by Sun et al . ( 2017 ) namely the "" International Ratio "" and the "" Global Direct Reach , "" applied to data gathered from FlightRadar24 for 2020 . Both indicators were calculated based on consolidated information for each city , considering airports within 1.5 h driving distance from the city center . Table 2 lists the airports included in each city as well as both indicators . The average value of the International Ratio equals 0.51 , on a scale from 0 to 1 , meaning that in average 51 % of the total flights serving airports associated with our global cities sample , are international flights . The Global Direct Reach resulted in an average of 62 countries with direct connections from each global city , a figure that is 637 % higher than the average of the total dataset including almost 3000 airports . The latter indicator when grouped according to the GaWC classification of Alpha , Beta , and Gamma cities shows that the first tier of global cities reaches an average of 88 countries with direct connections ( Global Direct Reach ) , the second tier of cities connects to an average of 63 nations , and finally , 57 direct connections are the average among airports in the third tier . These results indicate a clear connection between globalization , represented by the GaWC ranking , and the degree of international hypermobility expressed by the Global Direct Reach indicator .",296,58003857_1,2
648a39b81b9b678478896cd9,233371463,Nature Human Behaviour,8,"To the extent that the associations we measured reflect social influence , this research has implications for the design of public health and policy interventions to prevent obesity that may be realized using ubiquitous and readily - available data linking individuals to one another . Social influence could be leveraged to target particular individuals or social connections to promote healthy eating or disrupt unhealthy eating . Furthermore , the physical environments where social interactions occur could be designed to target pairs of people ( or larger groups of purchasers ) making food choices . For example , healthfulness could be encouraged by offering two - for - one sales on salads ( or other healthy foods ) for pairs of purchasers . Lastly , quantifying the social transmission of food choice behaviour could allow policy - makers and researchers to develop interventions and policies that efficiently target specific groups of people for increased population effect 31,32 . Eating together is an example of a public health scenario that likely involves a large "" network multiplier "" effect 33 . If food choice is "" socially contagious "" and an intervention improves healthy eating in a particular group , the benefit of that intervention will accrue not only to that group , but to individuals socially connected to group members , as well . This more complete capture of benefits will provide greater incentives for stakeholders to adopt health - promoting interventions . Though our findings do not prove the existence of social influence in food choice , they are consistent with such an explanation and together with these implications highlight the value of additional work to test peer - based strategies for promoting healthy eating .",286,231880553_3,2
648a3c641b9b6784789997cd,236251116,Cities,9,"Public opinions could also influence the design of public policies . A classic study conducted by Page and Shapiro ( 1983 ) examines public opinions and policy data of the U.S. from 1935 to 1979 , and finds out that very often public opinions cause policies to change , and could influence policies more than policies affect opinions . Therefore , an analysis of public sentiment could provide valuable insights into how policies should be implemented . For instance , Chung and Zeng ( 2016 ) have collected Tweets related to U.S. immigration and border security policies , extracted the sentiment and emotion of Tweets , and helped policymakers build a "" social - media - based public policy informatics "" system that could identify key opinion leaders and community activists .",132,9199368_13,2

Manufacturing and recycling steps are closely related . Accordingly , the digitalization and enhancement of the production processes may clarify and give key insights on how to develop concepts for a reuse of certain battery cells or a remanufacturing , for example , of battery modules and finally a safe and sustainable recycling process . Recent proposals call for the establishment of a Battery Identity Global Passport ( BIGP ) to support battery recycling . The BIGP is envisioned as a digital asset that accompanies the battery over its lifetime , from manufacturing to recycling , and should provide to recyclers the necessary information about the materials that are included in the cell , so that it can be processed in a tailored recycling process . In this scenario , battery manufacturers will likely be asked to mint the BIGP for their cells , which again underscores the need for common data structures to support interoperability , not only internally within a gigafactory , but across the entire battery value chain .",197,202729184_34,2

Prior research suggests that risk perceptions have two dimensions , susceptibility and severity ( El - Toukhy , 2015 ) . Susceptibility refers to the likelihood of experiencing a health risk , whereas severity refers to the seriousness of the risk ( Brewer et al . , 2007 ) . The local and national cases and death data due to the pandemic publicized by the media and captured in the Pandemic Impact metrics provide consumers with a measure of the pandemic 's prevalence in their local communities , impacting their risk perceptions in terms of their susceptibility to the pandemic . Further , such risk assessment by consumers affects their decision to search for information ( Maser & Weiermair , 1998 ) . Information search for pandemic - related paraphernalia captures the risk perception in terms of severity . Moreover , mortality data may also directly affect consumers ' perceptions of the severity of the risk associated with the pandemic .

In particular , we tested whether the difference in genetic attributions for antisocial and prosocial behavior was consistent with mediation by differences in ascriptions of responsibility ( as would be predicted by the blame validation view ) and/or by differences in judgments of the extent to which the behavior reflected who the actor truly was ( as would be predicted by the true self view ) . Study 4 was identical to Study 3 , except that there was no manipulation of the presence or absence of a genetic explanation , and participants rated Jane 's level of responsibility for behavior and the extent to which her behavior reflected "" who she truly is , "" in addition to rating their genetic attributions ( see Methods , Study 4 , Stimuli and Procedures ) .

A potential element of fragility can be found in HF4 , in the data and methodologies dimension : many different disciplines converge under the label of nutritional ecology , with their own methods , taxa , and concepts . Such interdisciplinarity is a resource only when a methodological integrated framework is at play ( Raubenheimer et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , each of the four instantiations tends to underestimate the role that unhealthy eating plays in relevant social occurrences , both formal and informal . Unhealthy foods may in fact enable experiences that provide highly desirable values , such as family or community identity , crucial for human psychological health ( e.g. , celebrations with specific cakes , see Barnhill et al . , 2014 ) . In this respect , each of the four instantiations could be marked with fragility since they do not include in their ontology specific food entities relevant for human well - being and they do not consider the aim of health in its multifactorial composition . 18 Polarization . Both HF1 and HF4 focus on the fine - grained layers of molecular interaction . The idea that diet affects physiology is at the very core of both positions but in substantially different ways . HF1 promotes the calculus of input - output , in which the body is the machine where transformation happens , and food is the measured input associated with projections on our body image and health - eat fewer calories to lose weight , take more vitamins to contrast aging . HF4 is not about knowing food components to create the right equation within the body - machine , but rather about how food affects our phenotype through mechanisms of attachment and removal of chemical marks to our DNA . In other words , it is about how food rules and shapes the metabolic equation ( Landecker , 2011(Landecker , , 2013b .

In about 65 % of the studied data the efficiency stated in the publication and calculated with our method are in good agreement , which means deviation is only about 1 % ( in total ) . In the other 35 % of the evaluated data the stated and the measured absolute efficiency is deviating > 3 % in total , in worst cases > 8 % in total , which emphasizes the need of establishing low light measuring protocols . The deviations can have the following reasons : First , inconsistencies in the theoretical input powers ( calculated with the relative LED spectra normalized to 200 lux ) and the given input powers in the references imply that the illumination is not measured precisely . Therefore , the performance parameters are measured at an arbitrary point of illumination . If the lux meter for instance underestimated the illumination and the measured points would be on a slightly higher illuminance in reality , this error propagates to all performance parameters . Consequently , the J sc of the apparent 200 lux would seem higher , because in reality it might have been measured at say 210 lux . A detailed discussion can be found in the Supporting Information . Second , as stated in ref . [ 59 ] , the theoretical J sc ( J cal in the ref . [ 59 ] ) should be consistent with the JV measurement , which is not the case for many publications . This inconsistency indicates that either the Q e , PV or the LED spectra are of insufficient accuracy . Consequently , an overlap of calculated data points and original data can not be achieved , because our calculation is based on the integrated J sc from the quantum efficiency whereas most publications work with the JV measurement data . Additionally , we remark to check the correct calculation of the efficiency , because in some data the simple equation η = J sc V oc FF / P in does not hold true or it is not clear from which parameters the efficiency is calculated . If all data is measured precisely at a defined illumination , theoretical values and the original data must match well . Therefore , this method also gives the chance to validate low light measurements and editors or reviewers can judge whether some data credibly reports a certain efficiency under a certain illumination condition . Note that optical neutral density ( ND ) filters , which may be used to achieve sufficiently low light intensities , have ( unlike what the name suggests ) a wavelength - dependent transmission which varies mostly at the edge of the visible spectrum . Thus , in particular the region λ > 700 nm becomes problematic , because at these wavelengths many organic solar cells for indoor applications will still absorb light well . The spectral dependencies of ND filters will cause changes in the spectra if used in low light set - ups and will therefore affect P out but more importantly P in at 200 lux and the efficiency .",557,213671700_17,3

648a47591b9b678478ccf95f,235511748,Journal of Cleaner Production,29,"There are many useful simulation tools for manufacturing system development . However , data exchange among different engineering phases and tools remains challenging due to the lack of a generally accepted data format . It potentially causes the random error generated by repeated data entry ( Hoffmann et al . , 2010 ) . Switching from virtual commissioning to semi - physical commissioning is difficult because the control functions should be connected to the physical system via the physical interface ( Lee and Park , 2014 ) . As shown in Fig . 4 , a digital twin system ( DTS ) has been developed based on the open - source jMon - keyEngine kernel ( Java language ) , which is an upgrading of our formerly - proposed digital twin system that developed based on the free - to - use Unity3D kernel ( C # language ) ( Leng et al . , 2020 ) . Different from the conventional offline simulation , the digital twin system interoperates the hardware equipment with digital models through establishing the channel between the virtual / physical controllers and the execution engine so as to control both the physical equipment and the cyber model . The digital twin system is used to conduct semi - physical simulation - based commissioning in a distributed environment . The digital twin implies synchronization among the physical system , simulation model , and execution engine of a smart manufacturing system ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) . The synchronization between simulation models and physical equipment is realized by a mapping between the hardware Programmable Logic Controller ( PLC ) and soft PLC through industrial communication . Moreover , it is driven by remote data from physical equipment distributed geographically based on high - speed sampling ( Hoffmann et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , the electric and mechatronic hardware - in - theloop commissioning of OA - FSMS can be done parallel in the digital twin system , resulting in lower debugging costs .    5 provides an overview of the integration framework and function modules of the digital twin system , which includes four layers : infrastructure , data logic , visualization , and application . Firstly , the infrastructure layer includes a database , programming environment , networking , and 3D engine . It synchronizes the cyber model and physical object to form the hardware - in - the - loop simulation model . It includes the objectification of equipment model ( e.g. , loading / unloading and storage devices ) , moving trajectory , sensing devices , control script , and communication standard . Secondly , the data logic layer integrates the hardware - in - theloop simulation model and control system for translating the upper - level production instructions into lower - level controller scripts / codes deployed to the physical equipment and feeding back the in - situ production information on time to the upper - level production control systems . By setting up the shared data structure , macro object , and instruction database , the communication channel between the digital twin system and the external planning system is established so that the instructions generated by the external planning system can control the operation of the device , and the results can be fed back to the external planning system in real time . Thirdly , the visualization layer includes the fusion of the 3D model and real - time data for supporting the tracking of system operation status . This layer includes a refined - parameter model library to support the rapid commissioning of process , operation , storage , and assembly . Fourthly , the application layer majorly includes the process compilation , multi - view synchronization , and   performance analysis . The process of commissioning is to continually call the model in the library and deploy it to the semi - physical simulation engine according to the established planning scheme . In the digital twin system , the digital model is consistent with the physical equipment in appearance , structure , behavior , state , kinematics , and dynamics ( e.g. , collision detection , motion trajectory , friction force , gravity , resistance , velocity , acceleration , and inertia ) ( Leng et al . , 2020 ) , which provides the runtime for manufacturing system commissioning . The OA - FSMS could be rapidly defined and customized in a drag - and - drop manner by combining the easy - to - use visual modeling and redevelopment IDE ( integrated development environment ) tool . An open data interface is established in the digital twin system to enable users : 1 ) to manually or automatically import control scripts , 2 ) to modify some functions in the process , and 3 ) to monitor the data flow in the breakpoint debugging manner , which significantly facilitates error troubleshooting . By supporting a drag - and - drop manipulation , the digital twin system enables the quick reconfiguration of the complex OA - FSMS model , together with its motion schemes and control scripts .",869,148568775_74,2

The model calculates the PV production starting from the climatological data and applying the algorithms concerning solar position , solar decomposition and transposition , and the solar shading . Crop yield is calculated by feeding the crop yield model with PAR and other key climatological and agricultural parameters . Photosyntetically active radiation ( PAR ) absorbed by the crop is calculated by considering the diffuse and beam components of the PAR and considering the shadings produced by the bifacial PV modules rows on the ground . The model developed in this study is based on the modelling and optimization framework of the open - source code OptiCE ( OptiCE , 2021;Campana et al . , 2017 ) .",134,35494390_28,2

[ 64 ] They adopted a single - ontology approach for the whole system and has BatteryDataObject as central term , which refers to the Battery being handled , the current LifeCyleStage , the origin of the data object , AnalysisMethod used and TargetInfluence . This ontology is designed to capture life - cycle - oriented information , but also contains basic battery descriptions connected to the BatteryDataObject through the Battery which hasComponent Component . Although it is publicly described , the ontology itself is not yet openly available .",112,4796697_4,3
