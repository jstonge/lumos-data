    "text": "Pathway analysis of differential gene and protein expression suggests that some CDK12 functions are conserved across cell types . In addition to cell type - specific regulation described above , we identified common ALE events that were regulated by CDK12 in multiple cell lines . From our experiments with SK - BR-3 , MDA - MB-231 and 184 - hTERT cells , and from the available datasets from HCT-116 cells ( 27 ) , we found that depletion of CDK12 promotes distal ALE splicing of the DNAJB6 ( DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 6 , MRJ ) gene transcript ( in SK - BR-3 , MDA - MB-231 and 184 - hTERT , avg = 0.24 ) . In an analysis of TCGA RNA - seq data for tumors containing CDK12 mutations or bi - allelic CDK12 deletions ( n = 18 comparisons ; mutation \/ deletion : control ) , we found the DNAJB6 distal ALE event in 78 % of comparisons on average , as compared to 46 % of control ( n = 54 comparisons ; control : control ) comparisons ( Fisher 's exact test P = 0.03 ) . Unlike the long genes that were regulated in a cell type - specific manner , DNAJB6 encodes two small protein isoforms ( 36 and 27 kDa ) from transcripts containing 10 and 8 exons , respectively ( Figure 8A ) . The short isoform of the DNAJB6 protein ( DNAJB6 - S ) is a cytosolic HSP40 family chaperone with implicated roles in Huntington 's disease ( 72,73 ) . By contrast , ALE splicing introduces a nuclear localization signal into the long isoform of DNAJB6 ( DNAJB6 - L ) and therefore it operates primarily in the nucleus . Increased nuclear localization of DNAJB6 - L has been reported to mitigate tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast and esophageal cancer cells ( 74,75 ) . We found that treatment of SK - BR-3 cells with CDK12 siRNA-1 increased expression of DNAJB6 - L with a concomitant decrease of DNAJB6 - S expression ( Figure 8B and C ) . This suggests that the high native CDK12 levels in SK - BR-3 cells can reduce the expression of DNAJB6 - L , consistent with overexpression of CDK12 functioning to promote tumorigenesis . We tested this hypothesis functionally in MDA - MB-231 cells , where DNAJB6 - L had been previously shown to decrease cell migration potential ( 74 ) . We first confirmed that treatment of MDA - MB-231 cells with CDK12 siRNA-1 increased gene and protein expression of DNAJB6 - L ( Figure   8B - D ) . To examine the cellular phenotype associated with CDK12 expression we used a scratch wound assay and live cell imaging of MDA - MB-231 cells as a functional test for cell migration ( Figure 9 ) . In separate assays we also coated the scratch wound with collagen - I to examine the ability of cells to invade into an extracellular matrix . Depletion of CDK12 by siRNA ( Figure 9A ) decreased the ability of MDA - MB-231 cells to migrate and invade into a matrix ( Figure 9B and C , ' Dep ' ) . In this experiment , cells were pre - treated with Mitomycin C to inhibit cell proliferation to ensure that the changes in migration and invasion rates were not due to impaired cell growth caused by the siRNA treatment ( Supplementary Figure S10A ) . The same result was also observed using a different CDK12 siRNA construct ( CDK12 siRNA-3 ) , suggesting that these observa-   tions were not due to off - target effects ( Supplementary Figure S10B ) . Transfection of CDK12 siRNA - treated MDA - MB-231 cells with a CDK12 cDNA to re - introduce CDK12 ( Figure 9A ) recovered the migratory and invasive properties ( Figure 9B and C , ' Res ' ) . Unlike SK - BR-3 cells , MDA - MB-231 cells do not over - express CDK12 . Therefore , we also tested the effect of CDK12 over - expression on cell migration and invasion . Compared to a vector control , MDA - MB-231 cells transfected with a CDK12 cDNA decreased DNAJB6 - L expression and were able to migrate and invade at a faster rate ( Figure 9A - C , ' OE ' ) . These experiments show that the ability of MDA - MB-231 cells to invade is correlated with CDK12 expression and inversely correlated with the expression level of DNAJB6 - L ( Figure 9D ) . Therefore , our results suggest that CDK12 can increase the invasiveness of a breast cancer cell line , likely through ALE splicing of the DNAJB6 gene .",

Contributions to the DEER signal that enable this analysis are schematically displayed in Figure S6 . The DEER primary data for hnRNP A1 singly spin - labelled at sites 231 , 271 , and 316 are shown in Figure S6 , analogous to the data in main text Figure 1H. The samples in this series were at 50 Î¼M protein concentration , labelling efficiency as determined by spin counting is annotated ( no spin dilution ) . Deuterated glycerol 50 % ( v : v ) was used as cryoprotectant in this series . A distance analysis was performed in the same way as for the distance restraints ( homogenous background correction followed by single - Gaussian fit ) and is shown as well . This analysis implicitly assumes that all of the short - range interactions that are not removed by the background fit arise from dimerized protein and that the monomers and dimers are otherwise homogenously distributed in the sample ( background dimensionality of the DEER fit is three ) . The distance distributions are very broad and very similar for all three sites , which demonstrates that the proteins are not interacting in a well - defined manner , but rather form a disordered complex or a condensed phase . Note that distance data derived in this way can only serve as a guideline to monitor proteinprotein interactions . They are probably a poor approximation of the actual distance distributions , given that a fraction of hnRNP A1 is likely in the LD state , where local spin label concentration is expected to be very high .",

    "text": "Through a multiple linear regression model , we correlated the share of users who abandoned PT during 2020 , with income equality variables , PT service characteristics , quality of service aspects and pandemic severity data . Empirical findings revealed that the presence of income inequalities resulted in lower abandonment rate , which could mirror the behaviour of captive users . Simultaneously , regarding PT trip characteristics , results imply that PT vehicle transfers and waiting time are the two most critical trip segments as per user opinion , for continuing or not using PT modes . Additionally , results confirm our initial hypotheses that : ( a ) in cities with higher pandemic impact ( as per number of deaths ) users were deterred to use PT and ( b ) improved disinfection in vehicles could contribute to sustaining ridership . Based on the empirical findings of the regression model analysis , specific policy implications can be derived . The methodology of this paper aims at identifying the key factors that influenced travel behaviour , in terms of abandonment of PT , during the COVID-19 era . These factors may highlight suitable measures , which can be followed by PT and governmental agencies , towards maintaining PT ridership during pandemic and post - pandemic circumstances . At first , the proper and frequent disinfection of vehicles could enhance the perception of safety to PT users and convince them to select PT . Likewise , changes in the PT network , towards the direction of providing more direct trips , can contribute to limited interaction between passengers and thus minimize the possibility of infection . In the same sense , PT operators should ensure that waiting facilities ( bus stops , metro platforms , etc . ) adhere to the health and safety protocols ( clean surfaces , proper ventilation , etc . ) , in order to build confidence among users that PT is not a hotbed of COVID-19 contraction . Furthermore , in regions with higher income inequalities , operators should expect a comparatively lower decrease in PT ridership and thus , the application of PT preferential treatment measures ( dedicated bus lanes , traffic signal priority , etc . ) ( Pulichino & Coughlin , 2005 ) would increase commercial PT speeds and ultimately improve PT service frequencies so as to address crowding events .",

Sacrospinous hysteropexy was non - inferior to vaginal hysterectomy for anatomical recurrence of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse : sacrospinous hysteropexy 0 % ( n=0 ) versus vaginal hysterectomy 4.0 % ( n=4 ) , difference â3.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval â8.6 % to 0.7 % ) for the intention to treat - last observation carried forward approach . Non - inferiority of sacrospinous hysteropexy was also shown in the intention to treat analysis with conservative imputation and the per protocol analysis . The original primary outcome variable of overall anatomical failure occurred in 50 % of the women after sacrospinous hysteropexy compared with 44 % after vaginal hysterectomy ( 95 % confidence interval for difference â7.4 % to 20.1 % ) . No notable differences were found for anatomical recurrences in the different compartments , except for the posterior vaginal wall : sacrospinous hysteropexy 4 % versus vaginal hysterectomy 14 % ( 95 % confidence interval for difference â18.2 % to â1.8 % ) . Table 4 shows the intraoperative and postoperative details of the women , including the secondary outcomes of complication rate and length of hospital stay . Five serious adverse events were reported during hospital stay : two after vaginal hysterectomy and three after sacrospinous hysteropexy . One woman developed paralytic ileus after vaginal hysterectomy . She had also experienced this problem after orthopaedic surgery . She aspirated gastric contents eight days after surgery , developed aspiration pneumonia , and died because of multi - organ failure . The other serious adverse events were atrial fibrillation , which required cardioversion ( vaginal hysterectomy ) ; stroke two days after surgery , but with full recovery and no loss of function ( sacrospinous hysteropexy ) ; postoperative pneumonia ( sacrospinous hysteropexy ) ; and anaphylactic reaction to prophylactic antibiotics before the surgical procedure ( sacrospinous hysteropexy ) ; in this last woman the surgical procedure was postponed for several months , without any problems . None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to the type of surgery . Tables 5 and 6 provide details on the other secondary outcomes . Functional outcome and quality of life did not differ significantly between the groups ( table 5 ) . Postoperative recovery was similar after both interventions , with comparable recovery index-10 scores at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 weeks after surgery ( table 6 ) . Among the patients who completed the pelvic organ prolapse \/ urinary incontinence sexual questionnaire before and after surgery , there was significant improvement in scores in both surgical groups ( P<0.002 each ) but no significant difference in total scores between both interventions ( table 6 ) . Flow of women through study . * intention to treat : two patients allocated to vaginal hysterectomy ( vH ) received sacrospinous hysteropexy ( sH ) and were analysed in the vH group . Data at six and 12 month follow up were missing in one patient after sH and six patients after vH ; one patient after vH had recurrent apical prolapse but pelvic organ prolapse quantification ( POP - Q ) score was missing , this patient was included in the intention to treat - last observation carried forward analysis . â Missed data imputed as failure . â¡Per protocol analysis : two patients did not receive intended treatment . excluded per protocol analysis : lost for follow - up at 12 months ( n=8 ) , missing or incomplete POP - Q score ( n=5 ) , and major protocol deviations ( n=9 ) ; two patients met two criteria to be excluded from per protocol analysis Pain scores on the visual analogue scale did not differ notably between both interventions , except for day 14 in favour of hysterectomy . In eight out of nine women who experienced buttock pain , a typically reported problem after sacrospinous hysteropexy , the pain resolved ( visual analogue scale score < 2 ) spontaneously within the first six weeks . One woman underwent suture cutting and vaginal hysterectomy after four months because of persistent pain localised at the place of the sacrospinous hysteropexy sutures . After this procedure she was free of symptoms .",

The measure included items such as \" since the war , people in this community have been good to you \" and ' since the war , you feel you have been welcomed back into the community where you live . \" As opposed to the daily discrimination scale discussed below , these items were not phrased to specifically refer to the experience of being a child soldier . Items were scored on a Likert scale with response options of \" not true \" to \" sometimes true \" or \" very true . \" This measure was administered at both waves of data collection and exhibited strong internal reliability ( Cronbach 's Î± = .90 at T1 and Cronbach 's Î± = .89 at T2 ) . For each child , we computed a subscale score for community acceptance at T1 and T2 . We also computed a \" change in community acceptance \" by subtracting the T1 score from the score at T2 . An increase in the community acceptance score between baseline and follow - up would thus indicate a positive change in community acceptance . Because change in community acceptance differed for those starting at higher or lower levels at baseline , all analyses were adjusted for T1 community acceptance .

The number of follow - up observations needed to reach this requirement as a function of the true value of Î» given in input is shown in Fig .   3 for different sky maps . It is clear that for poorly localized events like GW190521 , tens of GW follow up campaigns are Figure 3 . Number of GW events to be followed - up to obtain a confident association ( i.e. for a Bayes factor K = 100 ) between AGN flares and BBH events , as a function of the true input value of Î» in the simulations . Each curve corresponds to a different fixed GW sky map , with a range of localization volumes ( from â¼ 10 â4 to 10 Gpc 3 at 99 % CI ) . This figure applies to the ideal case in which the AGN flares associated to the GW events are all detectable ( we assume a magnitude limit g < 20.5 ) . The orange line shows a comparison with the result from Bartos et al . ( 2017a ) ( B17 ) , who do not consider follow - up observations of AGN flares , but instead compare the GW localizations with AGN positions . The other differences with B17 are that their N corresponds to the number of events needed to reach 3Ï using a pâvalue statistical method , and that they consider a slightly lower AGN number density . required in order to make a confident association , even in the most optimistic case where Î» tr = 1 and we can detect all AGNs where the BBH merger could happen . Only a few to tens of events are needed to make a confident association for better - localized events such as GW170814 or GW190814 down to Î» tr = 0.1 . This is an obvious consequence of the fact that the number of background contaminants scales with the comoving volume , and that the localization volume of these events is orders of magnitude lower than the one of GW190521 . We compare our results with the predictions by B17 who uses only GW localizations ( i.e. without follow - up observations ) to probe the origin of BBH mergers and to potentially associate them with AGNs . Fig . 3 shows that we find a similar scaling relation of the number of events required to reach K = 100 as a function of Î» as theirs , although slightly less steep than N(K = 100 ) â Î» â2 . The main differences with the B17 predictions , other than follow - up observations , are that their N corresponds to the number of events needed to reach 3Ï using a pâvalue statistical method ( so that here the scaling of the number of events needed could be different as we are not directly considering the width of a distribution ) , and that they consider a fixed ( in redshift ) and lower AGN number density .",

    "text": "ARIMA differs from other longitudinal analysis techniques in the social sciences such as latent growth modelling ( LGM ) and multi - level modelling ( MLM ) in a number of ways . First , it focuses on a singleunit dependent variable over time . It is suitable in situations where there is suitable aggregate data for a phenomenon , but where individual data may be sparse or incomplete ( as is the case in this study ) . Second , while LGM and MLM tend to be applied on data sets with only a few time periods , ARIMA is most suitable for time series with more than 50 time points ( Yanovitzky and VanLear , 2007 ) . Third , neither LGM or MLM adequately reflect the time series character of a data set and do not capture trends that are caused by the internal dynamics of the variable under study ( Hollanders and Vliegenthart , 2008 ) . This limitation is typically addressed via research designs with a small number of distinct time data points ( often two , three or four ) or with panel data sets ( Shin , 2017 ) . Notwithstanding , a key problem in such designs is that variables are expected to vary at random , so the common practice of selecting data every three or four time units ( Wilson et al . , 2006 ) , can easily result in the incorrect identification of a trend ( Kelly and McGrath , 1988 ) . ARIMA is designed to account for the complex internal dynamics of time series variables through the different mechanisms it employs , as explained above .",

However , long - range restraints at the molecular level in support of this model are still missing . Recently , we have reported pulsed EPR distance measurements to determine the intra - molecular distance between the extremal b - strands in aS fibrils . [ 15 ] A pair - labeling strategy was introduced to infer the orientation of the standard methanethiosulfonate ( MTSL ) label with respect to the plane of the b - strand , as the detected spin - bearing nitroxide of MTSL is located about 0.5 nm from the Ca of the amino acid the spin label is attached to . The resulting distance of ( 4.5 AE 0.5 ) nm between the extremal strands was consistent with the size of the subfilament measured in AFM and cryo - electron microscopic studies . [ 12 , 13b ] Nevertheless the dipolar oscillations observed in the pulsed EPR data , used to extract distances , were very weak and experiments at two different EPR frequencies were required to exclude artifacts . Similar observations were reported in other recent pulsed EPR distance measurements on amyloid fibrils of human islet polypeptide and tau protein . [ 16a , b ] The challenge of these experiments is caused by the required labeling procedure combined with the structural instability of these proteins with respect to point mutations . [ 17 ] To date , despite the wealth of NMR and other spectroscopic data , no EPR distance measurements on aS fibrils have been reported by other groups . In the present study we illustrate how an optimized sample preparation has provided large signals in EPR distance measurements for several selected mutation sites . The result permitted to exploit a labeling strategy to measure distances between largely conserved b - strand regions and to obtain vectorial information on the spatial arrangements of the labels within the strands . The distances and two - dimensional coordinates reported here provide new long - range restraints for the structure of aS fibrils .",

For example , O'Neil ( 2016 ) has suggested , drawing from her own experience as a mathematician in finance , that an algorithm used for HR processes , such as employee recruitment , evaluation , or performance appraisals , are still impaired by racial and gender biases . For machine - learning algorithms , these biases can also stem from the data with which the algorithm was trained . An algorithm trained on historic employment data , for example , would integrate that most managers are male , thereby assuming that women are less interested in management positions . Consequently , this recruitment algorithm would not show an employment advertisement for a management position via social media to women . The advertisement would , in fact , be invisible to women ; thus , women would have no opportunity to apply . In this case , a recruitment algorithm might be actively reifying the original gender bias , based on the data with which it was trained ( Devlin 2017;O'Neil 2016 ) . Similarly , Buolamwini and Gebru ( 2018 ) showed in a recent study that facial recognition algorithms still exhibit significant racial bias , as these algorithms are less able to detect the gender of African - American women than of Caucasian women . Accordingly , Noble ( 2018 ) found that internet search algorithms privilege whiteness and discriminate against African - Americans , particularly against African - American women . The key issue here is that developers of machine - learning algorithms use data to train their algorithms . As these data might be biased according to an external reference point , the training has the great capacity to be faulty ( Barocas and Selbst 2016;Martin 2018 ) .",

Model sequences were chosen based on a series of stable single - stranded structures that form GNRA tetraloops where N can be A , G , C or T and R must be a purine ( 10)(11)(12)(13 ) . The hairpins that can form from the tetraloops are unique in that they do not consist of a series of repeating bases ( 14 ) or large multi - base loop regions ( 15 ) . The stability of the four - base loop arises from a number of factors including base stacking between the third and fourth A , hydrogen bonding between an amino proton on the G and an oxygen from the phosphate between the second and third A , and base pairing between the G and the third A in the loop ( 10 ) . In addition to the model tetraloop sequences , a series of random sequences , denoted as random coils , were used for comparison . These sequences have no known stable structure and have similar melting temperatures and identical lengths . To study the possible surface effects on the hybridization rates , kinetic data were obtained both in solution and when one strand was covalently bound to a silica microsphere .",

    "text": "Olivetti et al . [ 57 ] synthesized the available data on consumption rates relative to available reserves for nickel ( Ni ) , manganese ( Mn ) , cobalt ( Co ) , lithium , ( Li ) , and natural graphite . They found that the ratio of known reserves to primary mine production ( also known as the static depletion index ) has increased for Co , Li , and natural graphite , suggesting that continued demand has resulted in additional exploration and extraction . Mn and Ni did not show an upward or downward trend , indicating that the ratio of production to known reserves has remained relatively constant . This highlights the challenge of attempting to place a single number on finite resource depletion as part of an LCA ; society 's understanding of available resources is not static . Increased demand drives advancements in exploration and recovery technologies . Material recovery potential through   recycling adds another layer of complexity . As Olivetti et al . [ 57 ] rightly point out , there is a time lag between when batteries are manufactured and when they reach the end of their life , so regardless of what can be recovered , recycling is unlikely to address any near - term ( 10 - 20 year ) material supply constraints . If battery technologies do not evolve away from reliance on these critical materials in coming decades , recycling can be an important long - term strategy . Pyrometallurgical recycling facilities will recover Ni , Co , Mn , and Copper ( Cu ) , [ 58 ] while hydrometallurgical recycling facilities will recover all of the aforementioned metals , as well as Li and aluminum ( Al ) . Direct recycling will recover an even larger range of materials , many of which can be reused without further processing . Given this context , it is worth revisiting the assertion by Peters et al . [ 11 ] that abiotic depletion ( an impact category representing depletion of non - renewable resources , such as minerals and fossil fuels ) is the most important impact of batteries on a normalized basis , exceeding the importance of GWP . Many of the nuances in critical material use and supply outlooks are lost in typical LCA practices and reducing these impacts to a single score is more likely to create confusion than generate useful insights , particularly when fossil fuel and critical material depletion are combined in a single score . This is particularly true for materials like Co and Li , for which demand is growing rapidly . In fact , a greater cause for concern is the geographic diversification , or lack thereof , in reserves and supply for some of these materials .",

CO 2 emissions data were calculated using Eq . ( 1 ) . Fig . 1 describes relative changes in emissions , energy consumption , and GDP in China during the period 1990 - 2012 . As shown in Fig . 1 , the Chinese economy has undergone spectacular economic development , with an annual growth rate of 16.31 % over the past twentytwo years . China 's GDP increased from 1866.7 to 51,894.2 billion Yuan between 1990 and 2012 . Although China has made remarkable developmental progress , it has not yet completed the historical task of industrialization and its development is unbalanced . Thus , China still faces an arduous task in developing its economy , eliminating poverty , and improving the livelihoods of its population . Economic growth can improve living standards , but it can also lead to increases in energy consumption and CO 2 emissions . While the economy prospered , it is worth bearing in mind that China 's total energy consumption jumped from 1311.76 million t in 1990 to 3617.32 million t in 2012 ( Fig . 1 ) . According to our calculations , CO 2 emissions increased from 1.89 billion t in 1990 to 8.02 billion t in 2012 ( Fig . 1 ) . The upper fitting curve in Fig . 2 shows the correlated relationship between economic growth ( the independent variable ) and energy consumption ( the dependent variable ) during the period 1990 - 2012 . The lower curve displays the correlated relationship between economic growth ( the independent variable ) and CO 2 emissions ( the dependent variable ) during the same period . As shown in Fig . 2 , the three variables are strongly correlated ( displaying high R 2 values . ) Fig . 3 displays a scatter plot and distribution overlay of economic growth levels , energy consumption levels , and CO 2 emissions data in the form of a box chart , with the bottom and top of the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles .

The authors found that while mouse embryos with Dicer - KO adrenal cortex cells developed normally up to E14.5 , at E18.5 they experienced total adrenal cortex failure . In all they found 16 miRNAs that were downregulated in the adrenal cortex of both E15.5 and E16.5 mice , including miR-34c , miR-21 , miR-10a and let-7d , which play a role in tumorigenesis among other functions ( 25 ) . They also presented lists of miRNAs specifically downregulated at each stage . We analyzed the mRNA microarray expression data ( see Methods ) from both E15.5 and E16.5 embryos using the linear model , miReduce , Sylamer , cWords and MixMir . When compared to the miRNAs that are downregulated at both E15.5 and E16.5 , we found that most methods were able to find either an exact or offset seed match to let-7d either as the first or second motif returned , with the exception of the linear model , which performed worse . Overall , MixMir ranked true miRNA seeds higher than the other methods in both E15.5 and E16.5 datasets ( Table 5 ) . Most notably , MixMir found both miR-34b and miR-34c in the top ranked motifs at E15.5 , which no other method was able to do . We also performed a separate analysis of motif ranks and miRNA matches for E15.5 and E16.5 separately , as some miRNAs were found to be significantly downregulated at one stage and not at another -- namely , there were more such miRNAs at E16.5 , as expected . We found sim - ilar results in this analysis , in particular that MixMir consistently found biologically significant miRNAs , with performance comparable to miReduce for both time points . cWords and the linear model were comparable for E16.5 only ( Supplementary Table S8 ) .",

Because most studies on the development of emotion perception , emotion experience , and emotion understanding are constrained to childhood , little is known about emotion conceptualization in adolescence . These results reveal that there are continued changes in emotion conceptualization throughout late adolescence and into early adulthood , a finding that prompts new questions about the role of emotion concept development in the social and affective changes that occur during adolescence . 11 Additionally , our methods ensured all participants recognized emotion terms used in our tasks . This is an important methodological advance beyond prior studies , which mostly assumed that child participants understood the terms used in tasks without systematically testing their comprehension . We believed that participants ' responses on these tasks are only interpretable if we had evidence that they had a working understanding of each term , a decision that potentially augments the validity of these results . However , this methodological choice implies that merely having separate definitions for emotion words is not enough to produce a fully multidimensional emotion representation : The sophistication of emotion concepts continues to deepen even after people have learned to associate different emotion definitions with different emotion words .",

    "text": "In view of device failure , it is important to consider why the like - species of oxygen vacancies and interstitials can cluster together as observed . We propose a schematic picture to enable a better qualitative understanding of the microphysics underlying the observed oxygen migration into rings , and the subsequent formation of clusters of oxygen vacancies and interstitials and the associated band diagram ( Figure 4 ) . Initially , incipient oxygen defects are uniformly spread throughout the as - grown TaOx film ( Figure 4a ) , which then laterally migrate due to thermallydriven forces upon formation of the conducting channel ( Figure 4b ) , as discussed above . Local changes in the electrical potential due to the clustering of negative interstitials and positive vacancies can cause significant bending of the tantalum oxide conduction and valence bands that can partially neutralize the charge on each species , [ 38 ] as indirectly evidenced by significant band - shifts in Figure 2c . This bandbending can decrease repulsions among likecharged species and also enable them to agglomerate , as the cohesion energy for oxygen vacancies can be quite low , and is likely to stabilize the ring [ 7,34,39,40 ] ( Figure 4c ) . We also calculated an approximate potential profile across the ring ( Figure S16 ) that look qualitatively similar to the one proposed in this cartoon . Subsequent lateral forces followed by clustering of vacancies and interstitials follows the initial bending of bands , as shown in Figures 4b-4c . Due to continued supply of energy through cycling and the large surface - area - to - volume ratio of the rings , they break apart to form clusters of oxygen interstitials and vacancies ( Figure 4d ) , associated with the fading of the ring observed in Figure 2b . Additionally , we observe that most of the bright regions in Figures 1b-1c are in proximity or contact with a dark region , and vice versa ( pointed out in Figure S3 ) . This suggests that there are significant vacancy - vacancy and interstitial - interstitial attractive forces or there are significant vacancy - interstitial barriers . The attractive forces likely originate from the strong clustering , as mentioned above . The barrier could originate from the oppositely charged defects in the bright and dark regions behaving as dopants , creating an electric field at the interface of these regions to prevent complete neutralization of the charged defects , much like oppositely charged dopants in a p - n junction . Direct observation of clustering of like - species is an important observation that shines light on a prominent failure mechanism of such devices . We specifically point to the fact that many real world devices are smaller than the ring features observed here and are operated at much lower power levels . Similar experiments utilizing low - power operations on identical devices have yielded strikingly different results , with the device endurance being much higher ( > 10 8 ) and no rings were observed . [ 17 ] As our measurements show , in - operando x - ray absorption spectromicroscopy is a powerful tool for studying chemical and electronic structure in oxide materials , including device evolution and failure with electrical     cycling and inhomogeneous localized phenomena . With in - operando , high - voltage electrical cycling of tantalum oxide devices , we observed the development of submicrometer features with a ring of oxygen interstitials and an inner core of oxygen vacancies , which could be reproduced using thermally - driven lateral forces . A key observation here is that a significant amount of displaced oxygen moved radially outward from the conduction channel and was stored as interstitials , with a unique spectral signature , in the tantalum oxide film rather than in to the adjacent tantalum metal electrode . [ 41,42 ] These results provide experimental data that help in understanding previous models regarding oxygen ion migration , [ 3,[5][6][7][8]17,26,32 ] metastable cohesion of oxygen defects , [ 7,34,40 ] role and sign of thermophoresis , [ 12][13][14]43 ] the composition and structure of conduction channels that tend towards failure , [ 5,6,8,31 ] and the localization of resistance switching . [ 14,37,43 ] Most importantly , we directly observed a failure mechanism caused by clustering of like - species of oxygen .",

Here , we show that mammalian CDC25B and CDC25C are novel interacting partners of TRIB2 . Consistently , the overexpression of TRIB2 promotes polyubiquitination and proteasome - dependent degradation of CDC25C. Our data suggests TRIB2 - mediated degradation of CDC25C takes place in the nucleus . In accordance with a potential functional role of TRIB2 in cell cycle regulation , we also find that TRIB2 protein expression is tightly regulated during the cell cycle .",

The latter process , in combination with multi - band effects , explains the transition to the p - type regime characterized by higher carrier concentrations and lower resistivity . For Pb 2 Sb 2 Te 5 , the influence of two bands with different carrier types even leaves a fingerprint in the Seebeck coefficient changing its sign as a function of the measurement temperature . For PbSb 2 Te 4 , on the other hand , the changing relevance of conduction - band and valence - band tails over the course of annealing can best be tracked in tunneling measurements of the DOS . Altogether , the experiments imply that the Fermi level must shift downward with respect to the band extrema upon structural ordering . The differences between PbSb 2 Te 4 and Pb 2 Sb 2 Te 5 in the Seebeck data suggest that the two processes involvedreduction of band tails and Fermi - energy shift - concur in different ways in the two materials , with Pb 2 Sb 2 Te 5 starting already with a comparatively low Fermi energy but yet noticeable band tails .",

    "text": "Gaussian linear dynamical systems ( LDS ) provide very efficient learning and inference algorithms , but they can typically only be applied when the observations are themselves linear with Gaussian noise . While it is possible to apply a Gaussian LDS to count vectors ( Belanger and Kakade , 2015 ) , the resulting model is misspecified in the sense that , as a continuous density , the model assigns zero probability to training and test data . However , Belanger and Kakade ( 2015 ) show that this model can still be used for several machine learning tasks with compelling performance , and that the efficient algorithms afforded by the misspecified Gaussian assumptions confer a significant computational advantage . Indeed , the authors have observed that such a Gaussian model is \" worth exploring , since multinomial models with softmax link functions prevent closed - form M step updates and require expensive \" computations ( Belanger and Kakade , 2014 ) ; this paper aims to help bridge precisely this gap and enable efficient Gaussian LDS computational methods to be applied while maintaining multinomial emissions and an asymptotically unbiased representation of the posteiror . While there are other approximation schemes that effectively extend some of the benefits of LDSs to nonlinear , non - Gaussian settings , such as the extended Kalman filter ( EKF ) and unscented Kalman filter ( UKF ) ( Wan and Van Der Merwe , 2000;Thrun et al . , 2005 ) , these methods do not allow for asymptotically unbiased Bayesian inference and can have complex behavior . Alternatively , particle MCMC ( pMCMC ) ( Andrieu et al . , 2010 ) with ancestor resampling ( Lindsten et al . , 2012 ) is a very powerful algorithm that provides unbiased Bayesian inference for very general state space models , but it does not enjoy the efficient block updates or conjugacy of LDSs or HMMs .",

    "text": "We have established that , although MnAlGe is not a van der Waals compound , due to the large separation between the magnetic square net layers of Mn atoms , the AHE is dominated by the 2D electronic features in the band structure . There are three important points we would like to emphasize . First , the electronic states near the Fermi energy were dominated by Mn - d orbitals , while the s and p orbitals of the nonmagnetic Al - Ge subunit only contributed far from the Fermi energy . The fat bands observed in Figure S2 , Supporting Information , clearly show the relative contribution of the orbitals in the band structure . Hence , the transport properties of MnAlGe were entirely determined by the Mn - square net layers . Second , the unique 2D distribution of the Berry curvature in MnAlGe that arose from the band anti - crossing of the nodal line perfectly matched the 2D FS obtained from the band constituting the nodal line . Therefore , the AHE observed in this compound originated from the 2D feature of the bands that contained nodal lines . Moreover , the scaling of Ï yx A versus xx Ï 2 indicates www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com the intrinsic contribution to AHE . It should be noted that the relation of Ï yx A versus xx Ï 2 is not strictly linear in the temperature dependent AHE data . Therefore , a temperature range 2 - 100 K has been used for linear fitting to obtain the intercept â560 S cm -1 as the intrinsic contribution ( see discussion in Supporting Information for the departure from linearity , Figure S17 , Supporting Information ) . Based on the ARPES study , the nodal - line anticrossings was situated just below the Fermi energy that enhanced the AHC . This can be understood from Figure 2f , which shows that shifting the nodal line from above to below the E F moves AHC from the base of a peak in the Ï xy A versus E data to almost the peak . This explains the observation of a large AHC in experiments compared to the value predicted by DFT , when the Fermi energy is placed below the nodal line . Finally , the part of the FS that contributed the majority of the charge carriers for conduction exhibited dispersion in all three dimensions . Thus , the electrical resistivity and the ordinary Hall effect will demonstrate a small anisotropy , which is consistent with experimental observations . Next , we discuss how MnAlGe compares with other well - known 2D , FM , anomalous Hall systems . Quasi-2D kagome lattice compounds Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 and Fe 3 Sn 2 have recently been established as topological Weyl and massive Dirac semimetals . Interestingly , the separation between the Mn layers in MnAlGe ( 5.93 Ã ) was larger than the separation between the two Co - kagome layers in Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 ( 4.39 Ã ) and comparable to that of the Fe - kagome layers in Fe 3 Sn 2 ( 6.60 Ã ) . Notably , while the FS in Fe 3 Sn 2 is open and quasi-2D , the FSs in Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 are 3D. The value of the AHC in MnAlGe was higher than in Fe 3 Sn 2 ( 170 S cm â1 ) and comparable to that of Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 ( 505 - 1130 S cm â1 ) . In a true , van der Waals , topological nodalline , compound Fe 3 GeTe 2 , the separation between the two magnetic layers was significantly larger ( 8.16 Ã ) , while in Fe 1\/4 TaS 2 , which forms by the Fe intercalation of the van der Waals gap of TaS 2 , the separation between the Fe layers ( 6.07 Ã ) was approximately equal to MnAlGe . Importantly , the AHC and FM transition temperature of MnAlGe were among the highest reported , as shown in Table S2 , Supporting Information .",

    "text": "of racial discrimination might affect children 's socioemotional development not only through an increase in harsh parenting practices , as hypothesised here , but also through a decrease in supportive parenting . Although we were not able to assess this mechanism with the data we analysed , other studies show that psychological distress is associated with less nurturing and supportive parenting ( McLoyd , 1990 ) . Parental support is important not only as a predictor of the healthy development of children ( Pettit et al . , 1997 ) , but as a moderator in the association between experienced racial discrimination and detrimental outcomes among children ( Simons et al . , 2002 ) . Future studies that are able examine the multiple pathways , and their particular details that link vicarious racial discrimination to children 's health and development , will improve our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of ethnic inequalities in health . We did not find any associations between living in a neighbourhood where racist incidents are common , and children 's socioemotional development . We had proposed in the introduction that living in a racist neighbourhood would have a detrimental effect on maternal mental health by producing a state of heightened vigilance from the constant fear of either them , or their children , experiencing racial discrimination . It is possible that hypervigilance may also be elicited via other exposures to racial discrimination ( including personal , and those of family members ) , and not only through living in a neighbourhood where racist events are common . This is a plausible explanation given the documented association between fear of racism and poor health outcomes ( B ecares et al . , 2009 ) , and that ethnic minority mothers report they vicariously experience racism by witnessing discrimination against their children ( Sanders - Phillips et al . , 2009 ) .",

To obtain pooled relative risk estimates we weighted the log of the odds ratios or hazard ratios by the inverse of their variance . We ran random effects models , which include assumptions on potential variability across studies . We used the DerSimonian and Laird Q test for heterogeneity . Since this test statistic has low power with studies of small sample size and excessive power if there are many studies ( especially if they are large ) , we also calculated the I 2 statistic for each analysis . 8 This statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance ( 25 % low heterogeneity , 50 % medium , 75 % high ) . We used Galbraith plots 9 to visually examine the impact of individual studies on the overall homogeneity test statistic , and we used meta - regression to evaluate the amount of heterogeneity of study type , sex , and migraine aura status on some of the cardiovascular events . We evaluated potential publication bias by visually examining for possible skewness in funnel plots 10 and statistically with the methods described by Begg and Mazumdar 10 and Egger . 11 Egger 's method uses a weighted regression approach to investigate the association between outcome effects ( log odds ratio or log hazard ratio ) and its standard error in each study .

To investigate whether these sites would eventually become accessible under conditions of low DNA methylation at the first - Alu , we examined JunB ChIP - seq data in either resting or activated T - cells ( 49 ) at the interval between the first - and the second - Alu ( schematic Figure   5F ) . Heatmaps showed that in activated T - cells , JunB binding eventually invaded the Alu1 - Alu2 interval at a small number of promoters carrying weak MeDIP signal at the first - Alu ( Figure 5 G , framed region ) . We did however not detect any signal beyond the second Alu element . We next used the same dataset to examine the distribution of NF - B at promoter - proximal Alu elements upon T - cell activation . Unlike JunB , NF - B was reported to use Alu elements as binding platforms ( 51 ) . Yet , we observed only minor accumulation of this transcription factor on first - and second - Alus ( Supplementary Figure S5D ) . In addition , this accumulation did not seem to correlate with promoter activity , as increased NF - B density on Alu elements was observed at the bottom of the heatmap , matching promoters with low H3K4me3 signal ( Supplementary Figure S5D , green arrow ) . This further suggests that Alu elements neighboring promoters do not systematically function as enhancer elements .",

Training the student on these trajectories does not always result in robust behaviour . This poor behaviour is caused by the student experiencing a different distribution of trajectories than the expert during evaluation . To compensate for this distribution difference , portions of the trajectories should be generated by the student . This allows the expert to suggest behaviour that will pull the state distribution of the student closer to the expert 's . This is a common problem in learning a model to reproduce a given distribution of trajectories ( Ross et al . , 2010;Bengio et al . , 2015;Martinez et al . , 2017;Lamb et al . , 2016 ) .

Fifty Italian consumers ( Mage 26 ; 53 % female ) were included in the pretest . We recruited these participants via the ProlificAcademic ( ProA ) online crowdsourcing platform given that its participants produce higher - quality data compared to other platforms ( Peer et al . , 2017 ) . We asked participants to indicate the maximum distance between the drop - off bin and the home that they were realistically willing to travel to dispose of exhausted batteries in specific bins . The smallest distance ( 50 m ) and the largest distance ( 5 km ) indicated by respondents were chosen for the manipulation of low and high proximity in the experiment , respectively .",

    "text": "We then evaluated whether combined inhibition of vessel co - option and angiogenesis is more effective at limiting tumor growth when compared to angiogenesis inhibition alone . Mice with established control - or ARPC3 - knockdown tumors were treated with the VEGF - A inhibitory antibody B20 - 4.1.128 combined with capecitabine ( Fig . 6f - h ) . In control tumors , which have a predominantly replacement HGP ( Fig . 6f ) , no significant inhibition of tumor burden was observed in response to treatment when compared to vehicle control ( Fig .   6 g ) . However , in ARPC3 knockdown tumors , which have a predominantly desmoplastic HGP ( Fig . 6f ) , tumor burden was significantly suppressed by treatment ( Fig . 6 g ) . In addition , although treatment with B20 - 4.1.1 led to a reduced tumor vessel density in both control - and ARPC3 knockdown - tumors , this effect was more pronounced when vessel cooption was suppressed by knockdown of ARPC3 ( Fig . 6h , Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . The administration of capecitabine alone did not significantly suppress tumor burden or tumor vessel density in either control - or ARPC3 - knockdown tumors ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . These data suggest that simultaneous inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co - option may be a more effective strategy for the treatment of advanced liver metastases than current strategies which target angiogenesis alone .",

    "text": "We have demonstrated an all - optical , fast , and non - invasive method to resolve , with unprecedented resolution , the crystalline integrity of atomically thin WS 2 crystals via experimentally probing and theoretically interpreting their nonlinear optical properties . In particular , we showed that PSHG raster - scanning imaging microscopy enables highresolution pixel - by - pixel ( pixel size of 120 Ã 120 nm 2 ) mapping of the armchair crystal axis orientation , which can be used to provide firstorder information on crystallographic imperfections stemming from inhomogeneities in the distribution of armchair orientations . Moreover , the measured pixel - by - pixel PSHG data were fit to a new theoretical model based on the nonlinear optical response of such crystals , which was utilized as a second - order filter that effectively enhances the optical contrast and provides quantification of the crystal quality in terms of the standard deviation of the calculated armchair orientational distributions . Consequently , we demonstrate an ultrahigh - resolution nonlinear optical method that can be used to identify small variations in the crystal armchair direction . This information with such a high resolution is unattainable by conventional SHG imaging as well as by Raman and photoluminescence mapping .",

    "text": "Since the seminal works of Kolmogorov ( 1941 ) and Kraichnan ( 1965 ) , it is well known that the turbulence in magnetized media should not necessarily be isotropic . In addition , after the past 50 years of investigations , ample evidence exists for various types of anisotropy of solar wind turbulence ; for a review , see Oughton et al . ( 2015 ) . For example , the radial evolution of solar wind intermittency using magnetic field and velocity as measured by Helios in the inner heliosphere for the parallel and transverse components relative to the local magnetic field has been investigated by Bruno et al . ( 2003 ) , suggesting parallel and perpendicular cascades ( Oughton & Matthaeus 2005 ) . The probability density functions of the magnetic field increments beyond the ecliptic plane using Ulysses data have also been obtained by Perri & Balogh ( 2010 ) . Moreover , it has become evident that to resolve anisotropy in turbulent solar wind flows , the orientation of a scale - dependent local background magnetic field is rather important ( e.g. , Kiyani et al . 2013;Oughton et al . 2015;Gerick et al . 2017 ) .",
