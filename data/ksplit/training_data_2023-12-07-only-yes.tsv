Data on GDP and total energy consumption were taken from the China Statistical Yearbook and the China Energy Statistical Yearbook respectively . CO 2 emissions data were calculated using Eq . ( 1 ) . Fig . 1 describes relative changes in emissions , energy consumption , and GDP in China during the period 1990 - 2012 . As shown in Fig . 1 , the Chinese economy has undergone spectacular economic development , with an annual growth rate of 16.31 % over the past twentytwo years . China 's GDP increased from 1866.7 to 51,894.2 billion Yuan between 1990 and 2012 . Although China has made remarkable developmental progress , it has not yet completed the historical task of industrialization and its development is unbalanced . Thus , China still faces an arduous task in developing its economy , eliminating poverty , and improving the livelihoods of its population . Economic growth can improve living standards , but it can also lead to increases in energy consumption and CO 2 emissions . While the economy prospered , it is worth bearing in mind that China 's total energy consumption jumped from 1311.76 million t in 1990 to 3617.32 million t in 2012 ( Fig . 1 ) . According to our calculations , CO 2 emissions increased from 1.89 billion t in 1990 to 8.02 billion t in 2012 ( Fig . 1 ) . The upper fitting curve in Fig . 2 shows the correlated relationship between economic growth ( the independent variable ) and energy consumption ( the dependent variable ) during the period 1990 - 2012 . The lower curve displays the correlated relationship between economic growth ( the independent variable ) and CO 2 emissions ( the dependent variable ) during the same period . As shown in Fig . 2 , the three variables are strongly correlated ( displaying high R 2 values . ) Fig . 3 displays a scatter plot and distribution overlay of economic growth levels , energy consumption levels , and CO 2 emissions data in the form of a box chart , with the bottom and top of the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles . Form Fig . 3 , we find CO 2 emissions to be highly concentrated at 5.26 billion t , and mainly dispersed from 3.33 to 6.68 billion t. Energy consumption is mainly distributed between 1300 and 2500 million t , and is concentrated at 1700 million t ( Fig . 3 ) . GDP is distributed from 8440.5 to 26,581.7 billion Yuan , with the most concentrated GDP at 12,033.3 billion Yuan .	45215519	yes

To increase the external validity of our findings we used a populist sampling frame to identify both the recipes and the ready meals . However , the nutritional content of recipes varied substantially between individual recipe books ( data available from the author ) , suggesting that a different selection process may have led to different findings . Selecting books that were bestsellers in the run - up to Christmas may have influenced the selection of recipes , and the transient nature of bestseller charts may challenge the representativeness of the sample . The size of the sample prevented subgroup analyses comparing individual chefs or supermarkets .	5347191	yes
The Agricultural , Forestry and Fishing sector ( A ) , has been the least affected economic compartment with a GDP variation accounting for 0.13 % ( −584 million euro ) of the total change . According to data provide by OECD ( 2020a ) , the COVI-19 related spike in the consumption of vegetable and citrus fruits has contributed to boost a significant increase in the demand of agricultural products , with Spain experiencing the major sectoral gains ( +587 million euro ) . In line with the analysis provided by Eurostat for the food - related retail sector , the demand of agricultural products increased during the two first months of the pandemic and stabilized in the following period ( Eurostat retail trade database ) . The non - closure of supermarkets and essential shops , together with the panic buying behaviours has contributed to sustain the demand of the agricultural compartment ( Jaspal et al . , 2020 ) . Consequently , minor variations have taken place for the related carbon dioxide emissions change , that reduced by 338 thousand tons ( −0.17 % of the total change ) .	231677611	yes
To compare our findings to observations , we extract the following characteristics from the computed spectra : ( i ) the ratio of the integrated redward over the integrated blueward flux ( L red /L blue ) -which is a measure of the asymmetry of the line shape ; ( ii ) the flux at ' draught ' between the peaks ( F valley ) in comparison to the flux at the maximum point ( F peak ) , which , in practice , quantifies the ' deepness ' of the draught of the double peaked spectra ; and ( iii ) the position of the red emission peak ( v red ) . We show the evolution of these measures in Fig . 3 from t = 40 to 100 Myr ( in intervals of 10 Myr ) with the last data point marked with a square . We compare this to observations of nearby , star - forming galaxies ( the ' Green Peas ' ; data taken from Yang et al . 2016 , also Henry et al . 2015 , and to z ∼ 2 − 3 Lyman - α selected galaxies ( Erb et al . 2014 ) . In addition , we also display other simulation results presented in Walch et al . ( 2015 ) , Gatto et al . ( 2017 ) , and Peters et al . ( 2017 ) ( shown as black circles in Fig . 3 ) . These hydrodynamical simulations include supernovae feedback with random SN positions and cover SN rates from 5 to 45 Myr −1 with none including CRs ( but partially include stellar wind and UV feedback ) . We show them only to support the case that the spectral shape we obtain for the ' noCR ' simulation is not an outlier -but in fact typical for hydrodynamical simulations containing thermal feedback . Fig . 3 shows that all the simulations without CRs produce Lyα spectra with significant flux at line center ( F valley 0.4F peak ; see also the left panel of Fig . 1 ) . This flux is reduced significantly from t 30 Myr in the CR simulations as the outflow is established . Also the asymmetry of the line is increased leading to L red /L blue ∼ 2 . Both measures are more in line with what is found in observations where mostly F valley /F peak 0.1 and L red /L blue 2.5 ( see also Steidel et al . 2010;Kulas et al . 2012 ) . Determining F valley observationally requires a high spectral resolution since the convolution of the true spectrum with the instrument 's kernel leads to a spreading of the peak flux , and thus , the true value of F valley can be even lower than measured . This effect makes our comparison of F valley /F peak conservative and the true discrepancy between the ' noCR ' simulation and the observations might be even larger .	76652853	yes

To analyse global costs of invasive crustaceans , we used data from the InvaCost database , which primarily presents costs from sources written in English , and sources from 16 additional languages ( Angulo et al . , 2020 . InvaCost captures cost data resulting from both systematic searches of the Web of Science , Google Scholar and Google search engine , and opportunistic contacts with experts and stakeholders . Each recorded cost entry was characterised by various descriptors as described by Diagne et al . ( 2020 ) and in the online database repository ( https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12668570 ) . InvaCost is a dynamic database that allows new cost entries to be corrected and added as they develop or are reported over time . The current version of InvaCost includes 13,123 cost entries ( i.e. reported economic costs , or rows of data ) of invasive alien species extracted from published peer - reviewed and grey literature ( InvaCost version 4.0 ; as of June 2021 ) . Although there may be costs that we have not captured ( e.g. , unpublished or outside the search languages ) , InvaCost is the most up - to - date compilation of invasion costs and therefore the best tool available to draw parallels with the current stateof - the - art in cost reporting and associated knowledge gaps . However , the results may change with future research and as monetary cost data become available for different species , countries , sectors , and other factors .	245553758	yes
Data sources . Almost all residents in Scotland are registered with a general practice and have a unique Community Health Index ( CHI ) number used by NHS Scotland . We used the CHI number to deterministically link all datasets with vaccination records in Public Health Scotland ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Vaccination information was extracted from the general practice records and the Turas Vaccination Management Tool system ; together , these captured all vaccination records , including those vaccinated in general practices , community vaccination hubs and other settings , such as care homes and hospitals in Scotland 40 . Further details on the data sources used in this study are available in a published project protocol 24 .	235393684	yes

Generating the sequence using a preferential attachment based model . We apply a preferential attachment based model to generated topic tuple sequences with power - law distributed usage of each topic tuple [ 32,37,38 ] . In the model , an individual 's activity is randomly chosen from the two actions . One is to explore a new subject and publish a paper with a new topic tuple . The other is to return to a previously studied subject and publish a paper with a topic tuple already used . The probability to explore is defined as ρn −γ in which the term n −γ captures the decreasing trend to explore a new subject as the number of papers increases . Consequently the probability of return , i.e. to reuse an old topic tuple , is 1 − ρn −γ . If one returns , the choice of existing topic tuples is governed by preferential attachment : the probability p i to use a specific topic tuple i is proportional to the tuple i 's current usage , so p i = n i / j n j where n i is the number of times that the tuple i is used . The parameters applied are ρ = 0.4 and γ = 0.1 . Each individual 's time step is controlled by the number of papers published , following distribution P ( n ) ∼ n −1.5 with a cutoff n max = 150 . These variables make the sequence generated similar to those in real data . We generate totally 20,000 independent sequences , a comparable number to the size of real data . See Supplementary Discussion 4 for more about the preferential attachment based model . Data availability .

The ubiquitination profile of Tau4RD protein obtained in ubiquitination assays in the presence or absence of full - length HSc70 was obtained by mass analysis of protein fragments after trypsin digestion . SDS - PAGE bands corresponding to ubiquitinated Tau were excised and subjected to reduction with TCEP , alkylation with methyl methanethiosulfonate ( MMTS ) , and in - gel trypsin digestion . LC - MS / MS analysis was carried out using a nano- Gly - Gly modification of lysine residues ( indicative of a ubiquitination site ) and the oxidation of methionine residues were set as variable modifications , while methylthio - cysteine was set as fixed modification . Data were filtered using a False Discovery Rate ≤ 0.01 both at the protein and peptide level . The results of the MS analysis are reported in MS_ubTau_minusHSC70.xlsx and MS_ubTau_plusHSC70.xlsx files . Due to the partially stochastic nature of the data dependent acquisition mode applied in the analysis , there is the possibility that some of the ubiquitination sites identified in Tau protein ubiquitinated either in the presence or absence of Hsc70 might be missing in the other sample simply because the parent ion was not selected for fragmentation or because MS / MS spectra were of too low quality to pass the filtering criteria . To consider this possibility the extracted ion chromatograms relative to the ubiquitinated peptides that were identified in only one sample ( incubated with or without Hsc70 ) were used to assess the presence / absence of the same modified peptides in the other sample ( supplementary_MSdata ) .	246475137	yes

To strengthen the stability and validity of findings , using the NCapture facility of Nvivo pro software , we extracted 20,000 Facebook and Twitter posts from January to May 2020 that used the most frequent hashtags , according to Ipsos.com . ( 2020 ) . These hashtags are # wuhanvirus # coronavirus , # covid19 , # quarantine , # lockdown , # stayathome , # stayhomesavelives , # workingfromhome . Following recommendations for netnographic studies , it was deemed appropriate to copy publicly shared archival data comprising all posts for this period and then filter this for relevance ( Kozinets , 2010 ) . Publicly communicated online messages are open to researchers , and , legally , it is the user 's responsibility to identify what information to share publicly on social media ( Kozinets , 2010;Langer , Elliott , & Beckman , 2005 ) . Accordingly , only public posts in English were included , also to avoid redundancy , a filtration option of NVivo automatically excluded all retweeted posts . The research focuses on individual users , not firms , organizations , governments , sponsored ads , or ads ; accordingly , ads , businesses , governments , and organizations ' posts were manually excluded . Hence , we proceeded with 4000 relevant Facebook ( 800 ) and Twitter ( 3200 ) posts for analysis .	237721938	yes

The global MPI itself and its associated incidence and intensity are estimated using nationally representative survey data , accounting for sampling weights and other aspects of complex survey design . This study uses the microdata that underlies the 2020 release of the global MPI ( Alkire et al . , 2020b , c ) ; Table D.1 in the appendix presents a full list of datasets , their dates , and their use in our analysis . For our microsimulations , we use 97 out of 107 countries covered by the most recent available cross - section datasets ( ' global MPI ' ) , excluding the 10 countries lacking the nutrition indicator which is essential for our simulations . For calibrating our trajectories , predicting the simulated shock in 2020 , and the final aggregation to the global level , we use data of the 70 countries for which we have two intertemporally harmonised cross - sections ( ' Changes over time ' ) ; see also Figure A.1 on this . Across these 70 countries , the global MPI datasets collectively comprise a sample of 6.4 million individuals , representing a population of over 4.6 billion individuals .	238478212	yes
Secondly , given the genetic overlap between traits , we observed that some signals were shared between sex hormone traits but appeared to have much stronger effects in one versus others . To help derive additional genetic risk scores that reflected this , we took all genome - wide significant signals within each sex but across traits , and performed ward - based hierarchical clustering 35 on individual variant Z scores . We used the observed clusters from these analyses to produce additional genetic instruments ( Supplementary Table 16 ): 8 . A ' male SHBG cluster ' ( N = 362 ) formed from SNPs with dominant effects on SHBG in men . Each SNP in this genetic instrument is weighted by its effect from the BMI - unadjusted SHBG analysis . 9 . A ' male testosterone cluster ' ( N = 122 ) formed from SNPs with dominant effects on both total and bioavailable testosterone in men . Each SNP in this genetic instrument is weighted by its effect on total testosterone . 10 . A ' male estradiol cluster ' ( N = 14 ) formed from SNPs with dominant effects on estradiol in men . 11 . A ' female SHBG cluster ' ( N = 373 ) formed from SNPs with dominant effects on SHBG in women . Each SNP in this genetic instrument is weighted by its effect from the BMI - unadjusted SHBG analysis . 12 . A ' female testosterone cluster ' ( N = 241 ) formed from SNPs with dominant effects on both total and bioavailable testosterone in women . Each SNP in this genetic instrument is weighted by its effect on total testosterone . Gene prioritization . We used the SMR software package 36 to systematically map associated genetic variants to genes via expression effects ( eQTLs ) . For all analyses we included expression data from liver , in addition to skeletal muscle in men and adrenal gland in women . All expression data were generated by the GTEx consortium ( v7 ) , made available from the SMR website resource section ( https:// cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/#DataResource ) . Only genes passing multiple test correction and exhibiting no statistically significant evidence of coincidental eQTL overlap ( assessed by the SMR HEIDI metric ) were considered . The same data were additionally used to perform global tissue enrichment using linkage disequilibrium score regression applied to specifically expressed genes ( LDSC - SEG ) 37 .	211074514	yes

Both programs have the common feature that they are based on one single Fortran code ( NMHDECAY SLHA.f or NMHDECAY SCAN.f ) that does not need to be linked with any other code . However , both programs need data files in order to check against negative Higgs searches at LEP in the numerous channels discussed in section 4 . These data files are available in the directory LEPCON , that can be downloaded from the NMHDECAY home page . Note that the directory LEPCON has to be situated in the same directory that contains the executable NMHDECAY code . We now discuss the particular features of the two programs .	13871951	yes
From the time series observations obtained between 2005 and 2019 , we have built eight different light curves . Additionally , we used data published in the literature by Jewitt & Sheppard ( 2002 ) ; Lellouch et al . ( 2002 ) and Hicks et al . ( 2005 ) , thus incorporating three additional light curves to our study from previous years ( figure 1 ) . All the light curves were corrected from light travel time . Because Varuna 's body is assumed to have an ellipsoidal shape ( e.g. , Jewitt & Sheppard 2002;Lellouch et al . 2002 ) , data from each light curve were fitted to a Fourier series m = Σ i [ a i sin(2iπφ ) + b i cos(2iπφ ) ] , where m is the theoretical value of the relative magnitude obtained from the fit , φ is the rotational phase ( calculated as the fractional part of ( JD − JD 0 ) /P , where JD is the Julian Date , JD 0 = 2451957.0 is the initial Julian Date , and P is the rotation period in days ) , and ( a i , b i ) are the coefficients of the Fourier function ( with i = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ) . In our specific case , we used up to secondorder ( i = 2 ) or up to fourth - order ( i = 4 ) Fourier functions . The second order is the minimum order that allows a double - peaked fit ; however , higher orders take into account small deviations on inhomogeneous objects and can be used to fit light curves that are highly sampled . The 2001The , 2002A , 2011The , 2018 and 2019 light curves were fitted to a fourth - order function , while the remaining light curves were fitted to a second - order Fourier function , because the number of data points in those runs was not large enough to use a higher order . Data were folded using Varuna 's rotation period of 6.343572±0.000006 h , which is obtained using the Lomb periodogram analysis of all our data , in agreement with the previous one reported in Belskaya et al . ( 2006 ) . The peak - to - valley amplitudes ∆m ( amplitudes in the following ) of each light curve are given by the absolute maximum and minimum produced by the fits . Table 1 contains the results from the fit to each light curve , i.e. , the amplitude and the dispersion of the residuals of the Fourier function fit to the observational data . One of the evident results is that the amplitude has changed considerably along these 19 years , with an increase of ∼ 0.13 mag .

Eurostat data have been used in this paper to estimate the carbon impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak for the 23 European countries for which consistent data are available . GDP data at industry level breakdown have been used to calculate the production variations that have taken place in the first semester of 2020 compared to the same period of the previous year . The carbon intensities provided by Eurostat for the year 2018 , and reported in Table A1 of Appendix A , have been used to estimate the CO 2 emissions change ( Eurostat Air Emission database ) . In Table 1 , the industry breakdown considered in this paper is reported together with the related NACE Rev. 2 activity classification . 1 Following the approach proposed by Han et al . ( 2021 ) , where carbon factors and GDP variations are used to estimate the CO 2 emission change , the carbon dioxide emissions drops are here estimated according to Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , where the carbon intensities of the NACE Rev.2 activities are assumed to remain unchanged from the year 2018 .	231677611	yes
We have previously reported on a non - randomized , open - label , phase I / II clinical study ( based on a lentiviral gene therapy vector ) involving seven pediatric patients with severe WAS . Details of the gene therapy study design and procedures have been reported previously 20 . The patients were treated at Necker - Enfants Malades Hospital ( Paris , France ; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01347346 ) and at Great Ormond Street Hospital ( London , UK ; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01347242 ) . Patients were enrolled in the Long Term Safety Follow up of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy for the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome ( WASFUP ) study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02333760 ) , which was designed to follow patients for an additional 13 years after the initial gene therapy study . The WASFUP study protocol was approved by the UK and French drug regulatory agencies and the appropriate investigational review boards , such as the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee in the United Kingdom and the Comité de Protection des Personnes in France . A CONSORT flow diagram detailing enrollment of the patients is available in the Supplementary Information .

Natural image patches We tested the scalability of the DDC - HM by applying it to a natural image data set ( van Hateren and van der Schaaf , 1998 ) . We trained the same generative model as before on image patches with dimensionality D x = 16 × 16 and varying sizes of latent layers . The recognition model had a hidden layer of size 500 , K 1 = 500 , K 2 = 100 encoding functions for z 1 and z 2 , respectively , and used 1000 samples during the sleep phase . We compared the performance of our model with the IWAE ( k=50 ) using the relative ( three sample ) MMD test ( Bounliphone et al . , 2015 ) with a exponentiated quadratic kernel ( width chosen by the median heuristic ) . The test establishes whether the MMD distance between distributions P x and P y is significantly smaller than the distance between P x and P z . We used the image data set as our reference distribution and the IWAE being closer to the data as null hypothesis . Table 1 summarises the results obtained on models with different latent dimensionality , all of them strongly preferring the DDC - HM . Sigmoid Belief Network trained on MNIST Finally , we have evaluated the capacity of our model to learn hierarchical generative models with discrete latent variables by training a sigmoid belief network ( SBN ) . We used the binarised MNIST dataset of 28x28 images of handwritten images ( Salakhutdinov and Murray , 2008 ) . The generative model had three layers of binary latent variables , with dimensionality of 200 in each layer . The recognition model had a sigmoidal hidden layer of size 300 and DDC representations of size 200 for each latent layer . As a comparison , we have also trained an SBN with the same architecture using the VIMCO algorithm ( as described in ( Mnih and Rezende , 2016 ) ) with 50 samples from the proposal distribution 2 . To quantify the fits , we have performed the relative MMD test using the test set ( N = 10000 ) as a reference distribution and two sets of samples of the same size generated from the SBN trained by the VIMCO and DDC HM algorithms . Again , we used an exponentiated quadratic kernel with width chosen by the median heuristic . The test strongly favored the DDC HM over VIMCO with p < 10 −20 ( with MMD values of 6 × 10 −4 and 2 × 10 −3 , respectively ) .	44086783	yes

Daily rainfall and temperature data were gathered from the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System ( MIDAS ) , which is freely available for on - line access to UK academics . These data were collected through a network of meteorological stations spread all over the Thames catchment ( and the rest of the country ) . Detailed information on the collection methods and quality control is reported on the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis ( CEDA ) website . Most measurements are made with full traceability to national or international standards . The daily precipitation , minimum temperature and maximum temperature data from all the available stations within the Thames catchment were interpolated on a 5 × 5 km grid using the Thiessen polygon method , and then the daily average precipitation and temperature series were computed and used as model input .	4218795	yes
Procedures for conducting a convincing sensitivity analysis may depend strongly on the specific model and data , and such procedures are still being developed [ 89][90][91][92][93 ] . The choice of other priors to compare is crucial , yet can be controversial . In applications for which the duration of each individual MCMC is long , an exhaustive sensitivity analysis may take a very long time , and efficiencies may need to be introduced . Therefore the guidelines here are general , and the analyst is encouraged to explore the literature for model - specific recommendations . Ultimately , the analyst must be thoughtful in exploring plausibly interesting variations in the prior and be forthright in presenting the results . Because of the potential length of a thorough presentation , online supplementary material may be needed and is encouraged ( see ' Make it reproducible ' ( BARG step 6 ) ) .

"Our cohort of successfully sequenced tumors encompasses 62 principal tumor types and > 300 detailed tumor types , representative of the diversity of metastatic solid cancer patients treated at our institution ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Table 2 ) . 43 % of all specimens were obtained from metastatic sites , most commonly liver , lymph node , and bone ( Supplementary   Fig . 5 ) . Two panels were used throughout this study , encompassing 341 genes ( 2,809 tumors , 26 % ) and 410 genes ( 8,136 tumors , 74 % ) , with all 341 genes included in the latter expanded panel ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Tumors were sequenced to deep coverage ( mean=718X ) to ensure high sensitivity for detecting genomic alterations in heterogeneous and low purity specimens ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Altogether , we detected 78,066 nonsynonymous mutations , with a median variant allele fraction of 0.21 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , as well as 22,989 CNAs and 1,875 rearrangements . The number of mutations and CNAs per sample tended to be inversely proportional ( Supplementary Fig . 8) . 13 The breadth and depth of MSK - IMPACT , and the analysis of patient - matched normal DNA , allowed us to detect important genomic alterations that would have been missed by other approaches ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . 81 % ( n=63,184 ) of all mutations fell outside the combined target regions of commercially available amplicon - based "" hotspot "" panels , which are also unsuited for detecting most CNAs and rearrangements . 6,14 Moreover , compared to whole exome sequencing ( WES ) where coverage depth is typically limited , downsampling our data revealed that at least 9 % of all mutations would have been missed by WES to a mean target depth of 150X , including therapeutically targetable alterations in BRAF , EGFR , and MET . Further , while WES is capable of detecting many more mutations throughout the genome and is better suited to the characterization of certain mutation signatures , MSK - IMPACT produces more uniform coverage across the most clinically relevant genes and can also detect targetable gene fusions due to the inclusion of breakpoint - containing introns absent from current WES methods . Finally , as 69 % of somatic mutations detected by MSK - IMPACT were not previously reported in the COSMIC database ( v78 ) 15 , these mutations would have been difficult to distinguish from rare inherited variants in the absence of a patient - matched normal . In summary , our results represent a rich , comprehensive and unique genomic dataset of patients with metastatic cancer ."	7537779	yes

Communications proximity , we assumed that these residues are involved in the same exchange process . Consequently , the exchange rate constant , k ex = k AB + k BA and minor - state population , p B , were assumed to be identical for all these residues , and only the chemical - shift differences between the major and minor states , Dd , which are sensitive to changes in the local environment , were assumed to be specific to individual residues . Solid lines in Figure 2 a show best - fit curves of this fit . The fit yields an exchange rate constant k ex of 8600 AE 1700 s À1 and a minor - state population p B of 3.1 AE 1.2 % . Residue - wise chemical - shift differences Dd are in the range of 2 - 5 ppm ( all values are reported in Table S1 ) . In order to investigate the reliability of these results , which were obtained from a single R 11 RD measurement , we explored the inclusion of additional , independent data sets : a first possibility , often used in solution - state NMR , would be the measurement of R 11 RD at additional static magnetic field strengths ( requiring , however , access to another spectrometer equipped with a fast - MAS probe ) . As an alternative , we use here a combined fit with CPMG RD data , obtained previously under similar conditions of fast MAS and deuteration . [ 11 ] CPMG RD is sensitive to exchange processes on msms timescales , making a combined fit with R 11 possible . Such an analysis of the present R 11 RD data with CPMG data , also obtained at a magnetic field strength of 14.1 T , yields values of Dd that are very similar to those obtained from the above fit of only R 11 RD data ( see Table S1 ) . The obtained exchange rate k ex is 2900 AE 140 s À1 , and the population p B is 9.3 AE 0.6 % . Although these values slightly differ from the values obtained from fitting only a single R 11 RD data set ( where k ex = 8600 AE 1700 s À1 , p B = 3.1 AE 1.2 % ) it is noteworthy that the fit curves of the combined R 11 /CPMG fit , shown as orange lines in Figure 2 a , are almost indistinguishable from the fits of R 11 data only , which shows that the present data are in excellent agreement with independent CPMG data . The differences of the fitted parameters point to the well - known fact that it is   ( PDB 3ons ) . Amides 24 and 25 ( black spheres ) are invisible in NH correlation spectra , presumably due to exchange broadening .

To understand the dependence of conductance on the light intensity , we perform experiments where the maximum light intensity in each illumination circle is gradually increased . The maximum conductance in each circle increases approximately linearly with the light intensity , as shown in Fig . 2a . When the light intensity changes smoothly in a sinusoidal form , the conductance of the nanocontact follows the trend of the light intensity and sinusoidally varies , as shown in Fig . 2b . Additional repeatable data of the current as a function of the light intensity is observed in the Supplementary Video S1 and Figure S3 . Based on these results , we conclude that the conductance of the quantum contact is regulated by the light intensity .	89617151	yes
In recent years , a lot of research has been devoted to the role of BAs and BAs receptor FXR , in NAFLD [ 45][46][47 ] . However , there is currently no explanation for the alterations in BAs composition in blood , the decreased ratio of secondary / primary BAs observed by us ( Extended Data 7f - j ) and others 45,47,48 , and whether it correlates with changes in tissue morphology 47 . Our data shed new light on this problem . The altered BC microanatomy and consequent pericentral micro - cholestasis may hamper BAs secretion into BC , as apical pumps ( BSEP , MRP2 ) have to operate against elevated luminal BAs concentrations . This would lead to back - flux of primary BAs into the blood , reducing their availability for conversion into secondary BAs by the intestinal microbiota ( Extended Data 7j and 8 g ) , thus contributing to the changes in BAs composition observed in NAFLD 45,47,48 . Bile flow is essential for normal liver function . Bile accumulation , due to its detergent - like properties , can cause liver damage 49,50 and bile pressure can affect metabolism 51 . Indeed , the accumulation of LD 52 and BAs 53 could induce oxidative stress and trigger apoptosis 29 , which is consistent with the reduction in pericentral hepatocytes observed in STEA and eNASH . The occurrence of pericentral micro - cholestasis is a new piece in the NAFLD pathophysiology puzzle that contributes to clarify some aspects of the disease so far without explanation , e.g. increase of GGT levels 54 , BAs in serum 55 , upregulation of MRP3 in NASH 56 and the beneficial effect of UDCA treatment in NAFLD 57 , all signs of ongoing cholestasis 41,58 .	91821024	yes

We use the cross - sectional regression model , logistic regression model and logistic growth curve in our analysis . Our dataset is collected from the Oxford Martin School and British Broadcasting Corporation . We compare the British Broadcasting Corporation classification on lockdown in association with the stringency index to reassess the appropriateness of this classification . We find evidence that during the period March to June 2020 , the total number of cases has a positive relationship to the growth of new confirmed cases . We find that this represents a reproduction rate that is an influencing factor against the number of confirmed cases which appears to decrease as the months go on . In addition , we find that as a result of lockdown , there is a negative relationship between GDP per capita and new cases . More significantly , we find that regional differences exist in the spread of the virus . In using the logistic regression model , we find strong support that Europe is approximately three times more likely to adopt a national lockdown than America . In contrast , Asia and Africa are less likely to adopt a national lockdown . As a consequence , there is a direct relationship between the reduction of confirmed cases per million and national lockdown across continents . We have therefore looked at countries which have implemented a national lockdown and compared the effectiveness of this against countries that have not implemented this measure . We focus on Europe as the majority of countries implemented a national lockdown . Our findings from the logistic growth curve reaffirm that in Europe , the daily number of new cases continuously began to decline after the first inflection point and second following the month of April .        Simple is the three - parameter S - shaped logistic growth model . Double is the six - parameter S - shaped logistic growth model . Inflection indicates the point of inflection and growth rate indicates the maximum growth rate defined in the logistic growth curves . Date indicates the date that the point of inflection or maximum growth rate is reached . Day indicates the number of days taken to reach the point of inflection or maximum growth rate since the number of new cases was reported in Europe . Our data set shows that there were three coronavirus cases reported in France on 25 th January 2020 which is the first day in the observational period .

As one of the popular topics in Natural Language Processing , many different approaches to achieve sentiment analysis have been proposed . One algorithm is to consider sentiment analysis as a classification problem - determining a Tweet as positive , negative , or neutral / subjective or objective . Bertrand et al . ( 2013 ) implement the classifiers using the Natural Language Toolkit ( NLTK ) , train feature sets with different labels , and generate sentiment measure by combining the output value of each feature set . Neppalli et al . ( 2017 ) use Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine as the two supervised machine - learning classifiers and use a combination of bag - of - words and sentiment features as input to the model . Gandhe et al . ( 2018 ) propose a hybrid approach that combines supervised and unsupervised learning in the sentence - level sentiment analysis model . This method takes partially labeled training data as input and allows researchers to classify unlabeled data based on lexical methods . The other type of sentiment analysis algorithm is list - based instead of classifier - based . The sentiment value of words in the annotated wordlist is predefined , and the initial seed of annotated sentiment words is grown by techniques like clustering . Nielsen ( 2011 ) has developed such a list by manually examining Tweets with high sentiment values and adding the antonyms / synonyms of such sentiment lexicon to the list . This sentiment - word list has 2477 unique emotional words ( mathematically ranging from +5 to − 5 ) . It is worth noted that Nielsen 's matching approach performs better than the more comprehensive list , Affective Norms for English Words ( ANEW ) , developed by Bradley and Lang ( 1999 ) .	236251116	yes

The effect of wavevector filtering has been confirmed also experimentally using a WSS - metamaterial sample that closely resembled the modeled ASR - array both in terms of its size and design parameters . The obtained images of the transmitted wavefronts are presented in Figure 3g-3i . Evidently , the patterns of the wavefronts , as well as their spatial - frequency spectra plotted in Figure 3j-3l   very good agreement with our simulations . The appearance of noise in the phase data at 0.23 THz ( and higher frequencies ) coincides with the diffraction minima due to the finite size of the pinhole aperture . Additional experimental data , including the wavefront images obtained at other frequencies and their comparison with the results of our simulations can be found in Supplementary Information . Although the limited bandwidth of the spatial - frequency filtering might be an issue for some practical applications , this problem could be addressed by employing the so - called double - continuum Fano resonance approach 32 , where the bandwidth of the effect is increased by stacking 2D - chiral versions of the metamaterial ( i.e. ASR structures lacking reflection symmetry ) 33 with adiabatically varied resonance frequency . Unlike the wavevector manipulation performed by the lenses , the demonstrated principle of k - selectivity does not rely on gradient structuring . As a result , metamaterials with strong inter - metamolecular coupling can extract plane - wave components from arbitrary shaped wavefronts . A remote analogue of WSS functionality and the associated ' tunnel vision ' effect might be found in conventional rayoptics systems such as astronomical telescopes : for the same magnification the telescopes with higher f - ratio ( i.e. slower telescopes ) will allow an observer to see stars and nebulas on a much darker background yielding overall higher contrast images . Such telescopes have smaller field of view , which limits the directions of the admitted light rays to those nearly parallel to the axis of the ' tunnel ' ( i.e. telescope ) hence blocking most of the light scattered by the atmosphere and immediate surrounding .	2888993	yes

To derive the data set of the studies for the analysis , we first used keywords accounting , education , and ethic * 1 as a search engine in the Web of Science . In total , 385 articles matching all three keywords were found in July 2020 . Next , we limited the search to the following science categories : business finance , business , education educational research and ethics , which scaled the list of relevant articles down to 273 . Third , we defined article as a document type ( after which 205 articles remained ) and English as a document language ( after which 192 articles remained ) . To prevent any omission of the relevant articles , we also ran searches with different combinations of keywords , including teaching , accountant and similar , all resulting in comparable sets of articles .	235401332	yes
Our sample consists of companies that are included in the 2004 SiRi ( Sustainable Investment Research International ) database , which holds sustainability profiles of companies included in the MSCI World Index . As this index includes the 1500 largest ( by market capitalisation ) equities in the world , our sample represents large corporations from developed markets . SiRi is an international network of socially responsible investment research organisations collecting a range of CSR information of companies for their customers , which are mainly institutional investors . 2 The network members use the collected information also for their local databases and other investment services . The SiRi data have been used in prior research ( van Nimwegen et al . 2008;Prior et al . 2008;Surroca et al . 2010 ) . In addition , the local databases of some of the SiRi members - among which Kinder Lydenberg Domini ( KLD ) , Michael Jantzi Research Associates , and Pensions and Investment Research Consultants - have been extensively used in previous studies . The SiRi database is broadly considered a reliable and high - quality information source on CSR data . The companies that are profiled in the database are all large public companies .	254384414	yes

"In order to test Hypotheses 2 to 5 , the independent variables needed to be reasonable measures of prior CSR and CSiR performance by a firm . In order to determine the level of CSR and CSiR performance , we used KLD ESG data by MSCI - a data set with annual snap - shots of the environmental , social , and governance performance of publicly listed US firms , and one of the most widely used sources of CSR data in current research ( Cheng et al . , 2014;Flammer , 2013;Godfrey et al . , 2009;Kruger , 2015 , etc . ) . KLD STATS assigns scores against CSR performance of firms across seven key ESG stakeholder domains : community , corporate governance , diversity , employee relations , environment , human rights , and product . Under each of these domains , there are multiple indicators of CSR strengths and concerns , specified separately , against which KLD STATS issues a binary score . Good / bad actions are recorded as "" 1 "" representing the presence of a strength / concern and "" 0 "" indicate the absence of an action . Summing up total strengths and total concerns across all seven CSR domains provides composite scores for aggregate CSR strength and concern ."	237756669	yes

We incorporate location - specific COVID-19 case and death counts into our analyses , as well as counts for the US as a whole . Such data represent immediate indicators of COVID-19 severity and are likely the factors driving Google searches for masks , hand sanitizer , and disinfectants . Although case fatality rates and the prevalence are epidemiologically better indicators of the severity and the transmissibility of the virus spreading in communities , at the time of the study , news outlets were presenting both the number of deaths and the confirmed cases separately , which were driving the public perception about the risk associated with COVID-19 . Therefore , for each state and city considered in the study , daily cases and death counts are obtained from New York Times data repository and used . 3 Fig . 4 shows the COVID-19 daily cases and deaths at the three locations of interest as a time series .	255441206	yes
For investigating the effectiveness of travel restrictions on COVID-19 transmission in China , we compared the population flow among 43 major cities ( including Wuhan ) during the same observation period in 2019 ( 12 January 2019 - 8 March 2019 ) and 2020 ( 1 January 2020 - 23 February 2020 ) . This data was extracted from Baidu Inc. ( Baidu Migration Map - Big data on Spring Migration ) . Fig . 3 showed the daily population inflow and outflow indexes of Wuhan and other top ten cities ( 4 first - tier cities , three transport hubs , and three developed coastal cities in southern and eastern China ) with highest average daily population inflow and outflow indexes . In Fig . 3 , the grey dotted line represented the day of Chinese Lunar New Year ( 6 February 2019 , 25 January 2020 ) . Because the spring migration was set according to the lunar calendar , we identified the observation periods in 2019 and 2020 according to the same lunar dates . Before the Chinese Lunar New Year , that was historically the peak period for spring migration with the increasing daily population outflow indexes of Wuhan and other top ten cities in 2019 and 2020 ( Fig . 3c ) . However , in 2020 , the average daily population outflow indexes of these cities were more than 1.1 times that in 2019 , especially in Wuhan ( 1.2 times ) . After the Chinese Lunar New Year , that was also historically the peak period for traveling and returning to work , with the increasing daily population inflow indexes of Wuhan and other top ten cities just in 2019 . Travel restrictions and large - scale control measures were implemented in China from 23 January 2020 , which caused a rapidly decreasing daily population inflow and outflow indexes of these cities . During this period , the average daily population inflow and outflow indexes of these cities were 30 % of that in 2019 , especially in Wuhan ( only 9 % ) .	231808069	yes
Hourly data were only used for the validation step . TROPOMI - based NO2 and SO2 data were compared with TAQMS ground - measurements for three test sites ( urban , urban - traffic and suburban ) in the city of Istanbul . To evaluate MODIS AOD 470 nm data , we applied AERONET data ( AOD440 and AOD500 ) with a time tolerance of ±0.5 h. Since AERONET does not provide AOD 470 nm , the mean value of AERONET AOD 440 nm and 500 nm values were calculated for AOD 470 nm retrieval relevant to MODIS AOD 470 nm ( Equation ( 1 ) ) . . 3 .

The shares of vehicles before the lockdown were estimated based on the total number of registered vehicles in each category in the city extracted from Automobile Club d'Italia ( http://www.aci.it/ ) , and the hourly flow extracted from a report by 5 T S.r.l . on vehicular mobility in the Piedmont region ( 5 T and Regione_Piemonte , 2019 ) . For the lockdown period , the share of each category in the hourly traffic flow in both working and non - working days was considered in the simulation . Since no data on the share of each of the 44 specified categories in the hourly traffic flow of Turin was available , and this type of data could not be extracted from the recorded traffic flow , an estimation for the share of these vehicles in the traffic flow was made . The data regarding the circulating vehicles was estimated based on the average number of kilometers traveled , and the data regarding the registered vehicles were considered in order to verify the consistency of the disaggregation into categories .	236179718	yes
